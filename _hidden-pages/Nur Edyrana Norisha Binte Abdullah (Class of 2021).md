Edryana uplifts those around her. Whether as an active participant or through leading her sports CCA or form class, she does so with the intention to benefit others.&nbsp;

An inspiring sportswoman, Edryana blazed her way into first place for our school’s Cross Country in 2018 and 2019, and second place in 2021. She also relished the 10th Tharman Shanmugaratnam Cup Veteran Volleyball Championship in 2019. A collaborative thinker, Edryana pulled her weight during the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad and Singapore Junior Biology Olympiads.

Edryana also rallies others to bring out the best in them. As Class Chairperson in 2020 and 2021, she steered her class to greater unity and meaningful Values in Action projects. As the Vice-Captain of Volleyball, she fought for glory with her team and coached her juniors with a big heart. Her fondest Bukit View experiences are with her volleyball teammates: “These moments are irreplaceable.” <br clear="right">

For her significant contributions in and out of school, she obtained the Edusave Character Award (ECHA) in 2019 and 2020, the Edusave Award for Achievement, Good Leadership and Service (EAGLES) in 2020 and the Chai Chong Yii Award in 2021.  

After graduating from our school, Edryana plans to pursue Sports and Exercise Science in Republic Polytechnic. We are confident that Edryana will continue to bless all those around her and we wish her every success.
