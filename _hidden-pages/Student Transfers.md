## Student Transfers

Student transfers are subject to the availability of vacancies and are therefore not guaranteed.&nbsp;

In general, transfer requests are processed at the end of the year to facilitate integration and learning for students.&nbsp;<br>Secondary 1 transfer requests (after the S1 Posting Exercise) will be considered if the student has met the&nbsp;[Cut-Off Point for that year](/admissions/Secondary-One-2023/studtransfer/) .&nbsp;&nbsp;

Transfer requests to Secondary 4 and 5 will generally not be accepted, in view of the short runway to the national examinations.

Students seeking transfer may complete this online&nbsp;[Transfer Form](https://go.gov.sg/bvsstransfer2024), with softcopy supporting documents.&nbsp;<br>Shortlisted students may be required to sit for a school placement test and/or attend an interview.
