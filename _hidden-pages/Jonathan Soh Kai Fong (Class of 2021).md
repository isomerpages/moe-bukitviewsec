<img src="/images/Jonathan Soh Kai Fong 1.jpg" style="width:49%" align="right">

Jonathan protects the Earth. He has the distinction of being the first to&nbsp;join our school by Direct School Admission and in Secondary 2, he became a&nbsp;JOULES scholar. Passionate about the environment, he had flourished in his primary school's Environment Club. Bukit View Secondary’s focus on the environment was thus a natural draw for him.

When Jonathan experienced our school’s Open House years ago, he was struck:&nbsp;“There was a strong green focus together with a culture of positive education.” Years later, his decision to join our school has been validated by great relationships formed with friends and teachers, and going further in environmental conservation.

Unsurprisingly, Jonathan’s most cherished moments with our school has to do environmental advocacy. He particularly relished interacting with the public and leading our school’s Environmental Club in key front-facing events such as Open House, Ecotrails and the annual Student Environmental Leadership Conference reaching close to 300 primary school pupils.&nbsp;  

After graduating from our school, Jonathan plans to pursue Environmental &amp; Water Technology in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Jonathan is saving the planet and intends on getting better at it. We are proud of him and wish him every success.
