<h2>Student Matters</h2>
<h4><strong>First Week of School</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1 . First week of school</strong>
</p>
<p>Once again, a very warm welcome to all new Secondary 1 Students to the
BVSS Family!</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming your child/guardian to our school on the

via Parents Gateway (PG) nearer to the date.</p>
<p><strong>2 . CCA Awareness Days</strong>
</p>
<p>The objective of CCA Awareness Day is to provide Sec 1 students with snippets
of CCA experiences to enable them to make informed choices in their selection
of CCAs.</p>
<p>CCA Awareness Day will be held on <strong>Wednesday 8 Jan and Friday 10 Jan.</strong>
</p>
<p>Your child/ward will be having his/her lunch in school before the CCA
Awareness Day. Please ensure he/she has sufficient cash to purchase food
from the canteen.</p>

<h4><strong>Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP)</strong></h4>
<p>As part of the National Digital Literacy Programme, to enhance teaching
and learning through e-pedagogy and personalising students' learning experience,
PDLP was launched from 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Secondary 1 students will need to procure their own iPads. Please
click on the following <a href="https://www.bukitviewsec.moe.edu.sg/admissions/secondary-one-2024/pld/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a> for
more details and procurement of the iPads for Sec 1 2025.</p>
<h4><strong>Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)</strong></h4>
<p>MOE will post students to secondary school through three Posting Groups
– Posting Groups 1, 2, and 3. Posting Groups will only be used for the
purposes of admitting students into secondary school and to guide the initial
subject levels students can offer at the start of Secondary One.</p>
<p>Throughout their secondary school education, students can take subjects
at three subject levels, known as G1, G2, G3 (G stands for General), mapped
from the previous N(T), N(A) and Express standards respectively. Students
will have the flexibility to adjust their subject levels at appropriate
junctures, based on their strengths, interests and learning needs. Students
will subsequently access programmes and post-secondary pathways based on
their various subjects and subject level combinations.</p>

<p><strong><u>Mixed form classes</u></strong>

strengths, and interests.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Offering Subjects at a more demanding Level (MDL)</u></strong>
</p>

<p><strong><u>Offering Subjects at a less demanding Level (LDL)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At the start of Secondary One, for students who offered English, Mathematics

may choose to take these subjects at a less demanding level (i.e., G2),
in consultation with their secondary schools.</p>
<p>Students who face exceptional difficulties coping with their Mother Tongue
Languages (MTL) will have the option to offer G1 or G2 MTL. At the start
of Secondary One, students can offer MTL at a less demanding level based
on the following criteria:</p>
