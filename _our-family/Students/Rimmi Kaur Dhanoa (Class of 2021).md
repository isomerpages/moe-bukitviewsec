Rimmi loves interacting with people. Thinking about her fellow Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) and Girls’ Brigade (GB) sisters, she intimates, “I am grateful for being part of an amazing family.”  

Rimmi credits the 2019 GB trip to Sarawak for the deep emotional connection she formed with fellow campers. She was also inspired by the way her seniors lived out the values celebrated by GB. When she became Staff Sergeant for the company in 2021, Rimmi sought to likewise be a role model for her juniors.

As President for the PSLs in 2020 and 2021, Rimmi expanded this positive influence further. For the Secondary One Orientation Programme, she mobilised the PSLs to welcome the youngest cohort by putting on display our school values of Zest, Grit and Gratitude.

After graduating from our school, Rimmi’s plans to pursue either Science or Accounting and to make an impact on more individuals. We wish her every success as she reaches out to more people and inspires them for the better.
