<p>At Bukit View Secondary School, we celebrate not just talent, but the
resilience that turns setbacks into success. Jeyaseelan Sai Hayagreev (4G)
exemplifies this spirit through his remarkable journey in Track and Field.</p>
<p>After narrowly missing out on a medal in 2024, Jeyaseelan returned stronger
and more determined. This year, he earned 2nd place in both the 800m and
1500m B Division Finals at the National School Games, clocking an impressive
2:08.99 and 4:14.29 respectively.</p>
<p>Jeyaseelan’s comeback is a testament to his grit and growth mindset. “Everything
is possible if you put your mind to it and have the correct mindset to
put the training in,” he shares.</p>
<p>His story reflects the values we nurture at Bukit View—perseverance, discipline,
and continuous improvement. If you’re ready to push your limits and grow
as an athlete and person, join our Track and Field CCA today.</p>
