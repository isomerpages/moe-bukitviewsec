## Alumni

Building bonds with our alumni has been an integral part of our alumni engagement. Every Bukit Viewan who has walked through our gates is a critical partner in our efforts to build our school culture as we work towards attaining our school vision.  
  
We are grateful that many of our graduates have returned to serve the school in various ways. Some have supported their alma mater by mentoring their juniors in their CCAs. Others have shared their expertise in their professional fields via our educational and career guidance programmes.  
  
We are also grateful to our alumni who have lived up to the school motto to **Care and Share** and **Achieve and Excel**. Dr Jonathan Loh is just one of many such graduates. His years at BVSS inspired him to pursue his studies in Science. Dr Loh moved on to do his graduate studies at the Genome Institute of Singapore, where he was a recipient of the A\*STAR Graduate Scholarship. For his outstanding work in the field of life sciences, he received the Young Scientist Award in 2009. What touched us even more was when Dr Loh decided to donate his prize money to the school to set up a book prize for outstanding science students. Despite his very busy life as a Senior Principal Investigator at the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology and as an Associate Professor at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, he continues to serve his alma mater in the School Advisory Committee.  
  
We see our alumni as a reflection of our school’s past, a representation of its present and a link to its future. Our shared experiences with the school’s tradition, history and legacy help us to preserve our heritage and affirm our culture and uniqueness as a school. As such, we hope to continue to (re)connect with our alumni to build this important partnership.
