## Siti Aisah Maduri

Mdm Siti Aisah Maduri graduated from Bukit View Secondary School in 2005. Some of her fondest memories are those for her CCA National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC). She used to have butterflies in her stomach before the start of every NPCC session. However, with strong encouragement from her peers, she grew in her confidence and eventually assumed the role of Station Inspector, the highest attainable rank in NPCC, and even led the very peers who supported her.

Feeling the urge to pay it forward and be an **empathetic citizen**, Mdm Aisah decided to be a teacher, enrolling in the NIE-NTU Bachelor of Arts (Education) programme. She did this knowing that she would be in a position to step into the shoes of others and help them make the most of their lives. Serendipitously, her teaching practicums were in Bukit View Secondary in 2011 and early 2012. In June 2012, Mdm Aisah joined the school officially as a teaching staff.

The life-changing impact she experienced from her schoolmates is what motivates her to serve as the 2nd IC for Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) in our school. She is passionate in helping PSLs offer peer-to-peer support through early identification of issues and timely intervention. More specifically, she loves helping the PSLs grow in their leadership skills. One way is by having PSLs work with the Sports Leaders and the Council to mount large-scale events like the Student Environmental Leadership Conference where student facilitators become **ethical advocates**. Another way she grows leaders is by mentoring PSLs (not in the Exco) in newly created sub committees to own and follow through initiatives that will serve fellow Bukit Viewans. We continue to be glad for our alumna Mdm Aisah’s ongoing work with strengthening student resilience and leadership!
