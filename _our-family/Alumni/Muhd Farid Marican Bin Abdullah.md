Mr Muhd Farid Marican Bin Abdullah graduated from Bukit View Secondary School in 2012. Upon graduation, Mr Farid pursued his passion in Singapore Polytechnic (SP) and graduated with a Diploma in Aeronautical Engineering from the school of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering (MAE). As an engaged learner, Mr Farid served as the Students’ Council Chairman and President of the MAE Club during his time in SP.

When he was a National Serviceman, Mr Farid also gave his best in all he did. Upon commissioning, he received the Sword Of Honour award and was posted to Special Operations Command (SOC) and underwent an 11-week Police Tactical Course for the Police Tactical Unit (PTU). He was also a recipient of the Best Trainee Award.  
  
Mr Farid is currently pursuing his passion in Mechanical Engineering again, now at Nanyang Technological University. Staying true to our school’s mission, he continues his journey as an ethical advocate by choosing to volunteer long term at a hospice as a form of extra-curricular activity.
