Mr Saravanan graduated from Bukit View Secondary School in 2007. During his course of study at National Technological University (NTU) as an engaged learner, he was one of the two Singaporeans selected to work with the US Air Force Academy for his internship. He researched and worked on a code to repair a faulty sensor in a satellite.

As an **empathetic citizen**, Mr Saravanan was actively involved in overseas community involvement projects, such as installing lights and fans for classrooms in Myanmar. Together with his team of volunteers, they painted the classrooms and even brought a telescope to Nepal to teach astronomy to the local children!  
  
With his all-round achievements, Mr Saravanan was conferred First Class Honours and selected to be the valedictorian for his cohort during their NTU Graduation Ceremony. His excellent academic achievements epitomise our school motto **Achieve and Excel**.  
  
During the Applied Learning Days in 2018, Mr Saravanan was invited as an alumni member to share his experiences of overcoming challenges as he pursued his dreams. He helped to motivate graduating students to strive for excellence in their academic pursuits and holistic development.
