## Johnson Lim

Mr Johnson Lim graduated from Bukit View Secondary School in 1995 and has been a regular donor to the school, giving what he can for needy students.  
  
When the COVID-19 outbreak became more serious, Mr Lim knew that many families would be adversely affected. Exemplifying what it means to be an empathetic citizen, Mr Lim decided to meet the practical needs of fellow Bukit Viewans. In addition to starting a small financial kitty, he reached out to his siblings (also BVSS alumni), school mates and friends to contribute. As one, they pulled together funds and grocery hampers for our students hardest hit by COVID-19. The hampers were distributed to these students before the start of the Circuit Breaker and was a timely help to them and their families.  
  
Our motto Care and Share was what drove Mr Lim when he decided to act. We are grateful and proud that he has chosen to live out what was imbued in him during his time in BVSS!
