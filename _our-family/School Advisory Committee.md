## School Advisory Committee

The School Advisory Committee (SAC) serves in an advisory and voluntary capacity to support school programmes, functions and activities. Led By Mr Lim Boon Lye, the Chairman since 2016, they offer sponsorship and help the school raise funds for developmental, infrastructural and enrichment activities to benefit students and staff.  
  
The committee members are an integral part of the Bukit View Secondary School Community and have built close relationships with the staff and pupils of the school. Members provide links and encourage networking between the school, the community and industry for mutual benefit and quality education. Their support and presence is both felt and seen at many school events like the Teachers’ Day and Annual Staff Dinner. The SAC also endorsed the MOE Edusave Character Award (ECHA) nominees.  
  
They have a keen interest in the students’ welfare and the school’s vision to develop ‘Engaged Learners. Empathetic Citizens. Ethical Advocates’. Thus, they have provided recognition for students’ achievements by giving out the SAC Scholarship and SAC Bursary. Needy pupils have also been provided with valuable financial help. They also give out the SAC Awards for staff since 2011 to recognize staff contribution. The School’s Ecogarden was completed in 2008 with a $27000 sponsorship from the SAC.
