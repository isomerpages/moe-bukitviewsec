## Logo and Song

<img src="/images/bvss-School-logo-w-no-background-high-res-300x300.png" style="width:30%">

Bukit View Secondary is serious about the environment. The significances of the logo (ie sun, mountains, sea and the colour of yellow, blue, green) are aligned with the environmental focus of the school.

**Yellow circle (sun):**  <br>
 – the brilliance of the sun that signifies our aspirations for a bright future through education.  

**3 green triangles (mountains):**<br>
 – the initial ‘B’ of Bukit. – symbolise the broad and solid educational foundation on which the pupils will continue to scale higher peaks in their studies, with determination, and to the best of their abilities.

**1 blue triangle (sea):**<br>
 – the initial ‘V’ of View.<br>
 – represents the virtue of magnanimity of our pupils. It is also the deep sea of virtues and morals that our pupils have to acquire through education.

**Peaks of the three green triangles:**<br>
 – 2 letters ‘S’ representing Secondary School.  

In use since Bukit View Secondary’s founding in 1986, it avoids the typical imagery of shields, books and flames.

<center> New heights we’ll scale everyday<br>
Persevering forward bound<br>
To care and share and to aim  <br>
For the highest in all our endeavours <br>
Bukit View, you’re so dear  <br>
We have learnt to give our best  <br>
Bukit View, you’re so dear  <br>
We achieve and we excel<br>
You taught us all that we know  <br>
And to mix hard work with play  <br>
Your bright eternal sun will lead us  <br>
The way to higher ground<br>
Bukit View, you’re so dear  <br>
We have learnt to give our best  <br>
Bukit View, you’re so dear<br>
We achieve and we excel<br>
We achieve and we excel
