## Principal's Message

<img src="/images/Mr Singh.jpg" style="width:20%" align=right>

Dear _Bukit Viewans_<br><br>
Welcome back to school for the new year. I hope you have had a restful break to recharge and reflect on your growth and pursuits over the course of 2022.

As we embark on the new school year, let’s focus our minds on how we can live out the school values:

**Zest**

A mentor once shared with me: anything that is worth doing is worth doing well. This message still resonates with me today. Give your best in all that you do – Studies, CCA, Pursuit of Interests, Healthy Pursuits, and Pursuit of Talents.

With Zest, we are likely to reach greater breadth and depth in our focus and achieve breakthroughs. Look around you and find inspiration from local and international personalities who scale new heights and discover new horizons with Zest – be it in their personal lives, in career, or in the betterment of the community.

As you prepare for the new year, are you committed to put in your best effort in all that you do?

**Grit**

When we embark on various pursuits in our journey of growth, we are bound to face challenges from time to time. How do we respond to these challenges? Look around and indeed reflect on your own experiences too. You will undoubtedly reach the conclusion that Grit is necessary to overcome challenges.

When we demonstrate Grit, we tackle even the most difficult tasks with zest, we knock at the door of challenges, we see things through to their proper completion, and we pick ourselves up even if we fail _(‘FAIL’ just means First Attempt in Learning!)_. We reflect, re-focus, and keep going. Indeed, some challenges can even be predicted so we prepare ahead to overcome these challenges.

Are you ready to persevere?

**Gratitude**

As we journey through life, there are many who stand with us – family, friends, classmates, teachers, and school staff. On the larger scale, we can appreciate the good education system in place to help us grow. We can appreciate the community that rallies together, and the nation that rallies us as one.

The most recent experience would have been how everyone worked together to tackle COVID-19. In your schooling journey, there will undoubtedly be many experiences you can recollect where you have been supported by those around you.

We can show our Gratitude through appreciation, kind words and gestures, showing care, compassion, and empathy, and being the best version of ourselves at all times. We can contribute to the community in class, in our CCA, in school, in our neighborhoods, and beyond.

Every day as you navigate the new year, count your blessings, be appreciative, and be kind to yourself and to those around you.

Welcome to the new school year! Let’s scale new heights as one BVSS.

Mr Jaswant Singh
