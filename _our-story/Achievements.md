<h4>SCDF Award&nbsp;for saving a man's life</h4>
<p>We are proud of Darryl Lee (4D 2021) who raced as a first responder to
someone who just had a heart attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Peer Support Leader Vice-President, Darryl was naturally other-centred
and as Track &amp; Field Vice-Captain, his training gave him speed.</p>
<p>What also served Darryl to serve others was first aid he had picked up
from a Healthcare Elective Module in school. He had received an award for
good performance in that course but helping to save someone tops any award.&nbsp;</p>
