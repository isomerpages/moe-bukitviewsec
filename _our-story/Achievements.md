#### SCDF Award for saving a man's life

We are proud of Darryl Lee (4D 2021) who raced as a first responder to someone who just had a heart attack. 

As Peer Support Leader Vice-President, Darryl was naturally other-centred and as Track & Field Vice-Captain, his training gave him speed.

What also served Darryl to serve others was first aid he had picked up from a Healthcare Elective Module in school. He had received an award for good performance in that course but helping to save someone tops any award.
