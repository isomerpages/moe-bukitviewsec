#### BACKGROUND

In Girls’ Brigade, our mission and objective is to develop each girl and officer to her fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling Every Girl a Leader, Every Officer a Servant Leader.  
  
Our GB Programmme comprises four aspects – physical, educational, values and social. Participating in weekly drills and physical activities like kayaking, games or outdoor cooking encourage our girls to work in teams with grit and perseverance to give their best. Educational sessions whether in baking, coding, craft or calligraphy provide opportunities for every girl to enjoy learning new skills with zest and enthusiasm. Through serving the needy and others in the community, our girls learn important values of gratitude, respect, responsibility and compassion.
