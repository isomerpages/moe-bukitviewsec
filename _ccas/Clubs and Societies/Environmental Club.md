#### BACKGROUND

<img src="/images/club_logo (200 x 195).jpg" style="width:25%">

The Environmental Club was formally started in 2005. We are a group of students who are involved in protecting the Environment as well as serving the Community through VIA. We applied what we have learnt in Science and has produced many green products such as organic soap, orange oil, candle in the jar and mostly recently hydroponic vegetables. The skills that we have learnt were put into good use and we were able to attain the Gold Award and the Most Earth-friendly Enterprise at the National Youth Business Challenge organised by Fraser Centrepoint Malls and Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Our other achievements includes the Lotus Sustained Achievement Award at the School Green Awards and the Gold award for the Green Schools @ South West CDC. Currently, we are embarking on several projects: Green School for Biodiversity organized by NParks, Urban farming and Aquaponics and worm-tea making. We also conduct our brand of ecotrail – Ecolibrium to Primary School Students.
