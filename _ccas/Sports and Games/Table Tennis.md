#### BACKGROUND

Our Table Tennis Team aims to provide opportunities for students not just to achieve excellence but also to develop themselves into well-rounded individuals by honing their leadership, sportsmanship and mental toughness.  
  
Students are committed to training that take place every Wednesday and Friday as well as on selected dates during holiday. Emphasis on techniques and skills are placed during training with our externally engaged coach. Physical fitness and teamwork are also among the other important factors the team builds on during training sessions.

#### HIGHLIGHT OF THE YEAR

Every year team players are selected to participate in the West Zone National School Games, as part of their exposure to the sports scene and also to cultivate sportsmanship and love for learning in conjunction with the Olympic spirit. The “B” and “C” Division Boys and Girls Teams put up commendable effort in the games, where they demonstrated zest and grit to fight for every single point. The “B” Division Boys achieved CCA Team Excellence Award in 2022. We will keep the momentum and look forward to a renewed vigour and focus in our Table Tennis Journey.
