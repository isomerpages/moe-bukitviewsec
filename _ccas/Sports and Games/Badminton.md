#### BACKGROUND

In Bukit View Secondary School, Badminton Club was established about ten years ago. From a small club with only about 10 members, it has been gaining from strength to strength. Currently, we have a total of more than 50 badminton members.

In line with our school emphasis on Positive Education, the main aim of our club is to inculcate positive purpose and engagement in students. We would like the spirit of sportsmanship, zest and perseverance to be internalised by our students. Our training is tailored to cater to the students’ well-being so that they value the positive engagement with their teammates and coaches during the practice sessions. Through the training sessions, Badminton Club promotes the awareness of good health and positive emotion during the workouts and physical activities.

#### MISSION

*   Inculcate compassion, integrity, perseverance, respect and responsibility among the members.
*  Instruct and train our students with the skills and techniques of playing badminton competently, and develop a positive spirit of sportsmanship.
*   Create an awareness about the importance of engaging in physical activities in our students’ daily life.

#### HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR

*   Every training begins with physical session which includes stretching, push-up and agility training. Subsequently, coaches will train the students with strokes, drop shot, net play and so on. Training is tailored to each student based on their needs and understanding.
*   Our training is divided into the senior division and the junior division. The seniors have their training every Friday while the juniors have theirs on Wednesday. The students are very enthusiastic about the sport. They are actively engaged during training. The culture of playing badminton is evident in Bukit View Secondary School as many students will play badminton in open areas of the school. Our goals is to inculcate the school’s values into this sport while engaging the students in meaningful and healthy activities for their all-round development.
