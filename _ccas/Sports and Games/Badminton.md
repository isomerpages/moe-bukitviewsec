<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
<p>In Bukit View Secondary School, Badminton Club was established about ten
years ago. From a small club with only about 10 members, it has been gaining
from strength to strength. Currently, we have a total of more than 50 badminton
members.</p>
<p>In line with our school emphasis on Positive Education, the main aim of
our club is to inculcate positive purpose and engagement in students. We
would like the spirit of sportsmanship, zest and perseverance to be internalised
by our students. Our training is tailored to cater to the students’ well-being
so that they value the positive engagement with their teammates and coaches
during the practice sessions. Through the training sessions, Badminton
Club promotes the awareness of good health and positive emotion during
the workouts and physical activities.</p>

<h4>HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every training begins with physical session which includes stretching,
push-up and agility training. Subsequently, coaches will train the students
with strokes, drop shot, net play and so on. Training is tailored to each
student based on their needs and understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our training is divided into the senior division and the junior division.
The seniors have their training every Friday while the juniors have theirs
on Wednesday. The students are very enthusiastic about the sport. They
are actively engaged during training. The culture of playing badminton
is evident in Bukit View Secondary School as many students will play badminton
in open areas of the school. Our goals is to inculcate the school’s values
into this sport while engaging the students in meaningful and healthy activities
for their all-round development.</p>
