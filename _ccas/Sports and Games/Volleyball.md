#### BACKGROUND

<img src="/images/Volleyball-Logo-300x220.jpg" style="width:35%"/>

The Bukit View Secondary School (BVSS) Volleyball team is dedicated to fostering a culture that provides our athletes the mental and physical training necessary to help them reach their highest potential on the court as individuals and team players. We stress the importance of self-discipline, positive relationships between athletes and coach, and individual goals and aspirations.  
  
There are two divisions comprising nearly 45 players altogether. Training occurs twice a week throughout the year to prepare the girls for various competitions, such as the yearly West Zone Inter-school tournaments and the Under 14 National Competitions organized by the Volleyball Association of Singapore.  
  
We have many activities that provide the players with the opportunities to improve on their skills on court. Trainings can be tough and tiring, but it definitely is rewarding when the efforts put in result in good performance during competitions.

#### MISSION

* Developing character through the pursuit of excellence

#### VISION

*   To create and maintain an environment that develops character and promotes leadership, responsibility and accountability among all Volleyball members.
*   Through these rigorous training, the girls are taught the importance of perseverance and teamwork, dedication and commitment, skills necessary for success both on the court and in life.

#### HIGHLIGHT OF THE YEAR 

##### PARTICIPATION / ACHIEVEMENT(S)

*   The B Division girls managed to participate in the National School Games West Zone Volleyball Championship this year. Changes were made to the competition format due to the COVID-19 situation â€“ the playing format was changed from 6V6 to 3V3, with each school sending in 3 teams. Although the girls faced many strong teams in our grouping, they persevered and fought hard in every game they played, and emerged victorious in some of the matches they played in.
