#### BACKGROUND

<img src="/images/Volleyball-Logo-300x220.jpg" style="width:35%">

The Bukit View Secondary School (BVSS) Volleyball team is dedicated to fostering a culture that provides our athletes the mental and physical training necessary to help them reach their highest potential on the court as individuals and team players. We stress the importance of self-discipline, positive relationships between athletes and coach, and individual goals and aspirations.  
  
There are two divisions comprising nearly 45 players altogether. Training occurs twice a week throughout the year to prepare the girls for various competitions, such as the yearly West Zone Inter-school tournaments and the Under 14 National Competitions organized by the Volleyball Association of Singapore.  
  
We have many activities that provide the players with the opportunities to improve on their skills on court. Trainings can be tough and tiring, but it definitely is rewarding when the efforts put in result in good performance during competitions.
