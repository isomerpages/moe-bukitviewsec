#### BACKGROUND

The BVSS Dance Club aims to expose members to many forms of dance to develop their artistic sensibilities. Various platforms, within the school, at the community and national levels, are provided for the members to showcase their talents. Members hone their dance skills and deepen their appreciation towards the aesthetics. As they become more confident, they are encouraged to further develop their passion and discover their full potential. They also acquire values of teamwork, discipline and responsibility in the process.  
  
The instructors work closely with the teachers-in-charge to craft the dance programme at the start of the year. During regular practice sessions, members are trained on the basic moves and dance techniques to build up their competencies. Different dance genres are also introduced to allow the members to acquire the performance skills. The dance members train hard prior to each performance and have been sustaining excellent performances over the years.  
  
#### OBJECTIVES

The objectives of BVSS Dance Club are to nurture the love for dance as a performing art and to expose the students to various genres of dance in order to encourage creativity, resilience and passion for the arts.
