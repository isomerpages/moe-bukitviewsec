#### BACKGROUND

Since 2022, the BVSS Choir finally had the chance to interact face to face with the new Secondary One members after a period of having online Co-Curricular Activities (e-CCA) due to COVID. Some bonding games included Blow Wind Blow, Dog and Bone, Card games and the highlight of the year, an Amazing Race at Vivo City. 

We attended face to face rehearsals in our beloved Music Room and learnt together as a whole Choir. We enjoyed singing in the company of our friends and seniors in preparation of our Choir concert at the Lee Foundation Theatre in Nov 2022. 

Since the start of 2023, we have been busy preparing for our Arts Presentation for Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2023. We overcame various challenges and did our best on stage, making Bukit View Secondary School proud by achieving a Certificate of Achievement in our attempt.

Moving forward, we hope to challenge the boundaries of our voices and minds and remain faithful to the friendships forged by our shared experience of singing together.

Please enjoy “I Got Rhythm” from our November 2022 concert.
