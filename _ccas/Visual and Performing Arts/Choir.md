#### BACKGROUND

In 2022, the BVSS Choir finally had the chance to interact face to face with the new Secondary One members after a period of having online Co-Curricular Activities (e-CCA) due to COVID. Some bonding games included Blow Wind Blow, Dog and Bone, Card games and the highlight of the year, an Amazing Race at Vivo City. 

We attended face to face rehearsals in our beloved Music Room and learnt together as a whole Choir. We filmed a unique Malay-Chinese song entitled “Ceria Xi Yang Yang” to celebrate Chinese New Year 2022 and “All Things Bright And Beautiful” for our school’s Achieve and Excel Day. We enjoyed the company of our friends whom we had missed tremendously in the previous year.

Please enjoy a snippet of our song “All Things Bright and Beautiful”.

The BV Choir’s hard work and tenacity was also showcased in Voices Of Singapore’s Virtual choir concert (Day 1). We sang “You are My Sunshine”, which was the title song for our concert last year. Please view our performance here. 🙂
