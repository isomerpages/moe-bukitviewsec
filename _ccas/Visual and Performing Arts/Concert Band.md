#### BACKGROUND

The Band seeks to bring out the best in all our members. Our members are given opportunities to perform in concerts and school events. We also give ample opportunities to hone their leadership and organization skills through the weekly practices and engaging activities such as camps and games. This year, the Band was able to showcase their talents as part of the National Day Observance Ceremony, as well as obtain an Accomplishment Award at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. We look forward to an exciting 2021 as we prepare for next year’s programme.
