*	**EXCELLENCE**: Exceeding expectations in all endeavours in our Musical Journey.

#### BACKGROUND

The Band seeks to bring out the best in all our members. Our members are given opportunities to perform in concerts and school events. We also give ample opportunities to hone their leadership and organization skills through the weekly practices and engaging activities such as camps and games.
