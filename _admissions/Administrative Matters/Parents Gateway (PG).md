<p><strong>Parents Gateway (PG)</strong> is MOE’s official mobile application
developed by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and GovTech. Our school uses
Parents Gateway as the main platform to communicate with parents on school
matters.</p>
<p>Through the free app, parents will receive timely information about school
activities and events (e.g. enrichment programmes, CCAs, learning journeys)
via push notifications. Parents can also provide consent for their child’s
activities directly through the app.</p>
<p>Parents with children in different schools will be able to receive notifications
for all children within the same Parents Gateway app. Each parent may download
the app individually to receive notices.
