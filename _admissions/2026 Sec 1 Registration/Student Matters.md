<h2>Student Matters</h2>
<h4><strong>First Week of School</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1 . First week of school</strong>
</p>
<p>Once again, a very warm welcome to all new Secondary 1 Students to the
BVSS Family!</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming your child/guardian to our school on the
first day of school on <strong>Friday 2 January 2026.</strong>
</p>
<p>Please ensure your child/ward reports to the canteen <strong><u>before 7.40 am in BVSS PE T-shirt and brown shorts/ culottes. </u></strong>Our
Student Leaders will guide them to find and join their form classes for

to school in their primary school attire or PE attire.</p>
<p>More details will be provided by the Year Head Mr Lee Jia Hao via Parents
Gateway (PG) nearer to the date.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2 . CCA Awareness Days</strong>
</p>
<p>The objective of CCA Awareness Day is to provide Sec 1 students with snippets
of CCA experiences to enable them to make informed choices in their selection
of CCAs.</p>
<p>CCA Awareness Day will be held during the Sec 1 Orientation Programme
on <strong>2, 5 and 6 January.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>

<h4><strong>Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP)</strong></h4>
<p>As part of the National Digital Literacy Programme, to enhance teaching
and learning through e-pedagogy and personalising students' learning experience,
PDLP was launched from 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Bukit View Secondary, Secondary 1 students will be using Apple iPad
as their personal learning device. Every iPad will come bundled with Apple
pencil and casing with smart keyboard to maximise the affordances of the
iPad as a learning tool. Please click on the following <a href="https://www.bukitviewsec.moe.edu.sg/admissions/secondary-one-2024/pld/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a> for
more details and procurement of the iPads for Sec 1 2026.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)</strong></h4>
<p>MOE will post students to secondary school through three Posting Groups
– Posting Groups 1, 2, and 3. Posting Groups will only be used for the
purposes of admitting students into secondary school and to guide the initial
subject levels students can offer at the start of Secondary One.</p>
<p>Throughout their secondary school education, students can take subjects
at three subject levels, known as G1, G2, G3 (G stands for General), mapped
from the previous N(T), N(A) and Express standards respectively. Students
will have the flexibility to adjust their subject levels at appropriate
junctures, based on their strengths, interests and learning needs. Students
will subsequently access programmes and post-secondary pathways based on
their various subjects and subject level combinations.</p>

<p><strong><u>Mixed form classes</u></strong>

<p>Once students enter secondary school, they will be grouped into mixed
form classes comprising students from different Posting Groups and will
have opportunities to interact and learn with peers of different backgrounds,
strengths, and interests.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Offering Subjects at a more demanding Level (MDL)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At the start of Secondary One, eligible students can offer English Language

<p><strong><u>Offering Subjects at a less demanding Level (LDL)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At the start of Secondary One, for students who offered English, Mathematics
and/or Science at Foundation level at PSLE, but are otherwise eligible
to take most of their subjects at G3 when entering secondary school, they
may choose to take these subjects at a less demanding level (i.e., G2),
in consultation with their secondary schools.</p>
<p>Students who face exceptional difficulties coping with their Mother Tongue
Languages (MTL) will have the option to offer G1 or G2 MTL. At the start
of Secondary One, students can offer MTL at a less demanding level based
on the following criteria:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

curriculum time taking a set of six common curriculum subjects:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Sec1Reg/common_curriculum_subjects.png">

learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.</p>
<p><strong>Subjects Offered at G1, G2 and G3</strong>
</p>
<p>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, Science, and Humanities
