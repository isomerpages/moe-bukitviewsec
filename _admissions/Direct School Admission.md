## Direct School Admission

#### Information on 2022 Direct School Admission (DSA) to Bukit View Secondary School

(For admission to Sec One in 2023)

<b><u>Introduction</b></u>
  
The DSA-Sec Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004. It seeks to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school.  
  
**When choosing a secondary school, parents are encouraged to consider the students’ aptitudes and strengths, the school’s academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the students’ talents.**

The Bukit View Secondary School (BVSS) DSA Exercise 2022 invites students in Primary 6 or equivalent (for overseas students) in 2022 with exceptional leadership, talent and/or interest in the following talent areas to apply for direct entry to the Secondary 1 cohort of 2023.

Students who are successfully admitted to BVSS via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school by participating in the activities related to the talent they are selected for.
