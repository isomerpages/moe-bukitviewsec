## Direct School Admission

#### Information on 2022 Direct School Admission (DSA) to Bukit View Secondary School

(For admission to Sec One in 2023)

<b><u>Introduction</b></u>
  
The DSA-Sec Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004. It seeks to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school.  
  
**When choosing a secondary school, parents are encouraged to consider the students’ aptitudes and strengths, the school’s academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the students’ talents.**
