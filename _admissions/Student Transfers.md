## Student Transfers

Student transfers are subject to the availability of vacancies and are therefore not guaranteed. 

In general, transfer requests are processed at the end of the year to facilitate integration and learning for students. <br>Secondary 1 transfer requests (after the S1 Posting Exercise) will be considered if the student has met the [Cut-Off Point for that year](https://bukitviewsec.moe.edu.sg/admissions/secondary-one-2023/student-transfers)**link isomer**.  

Transfer requests to Secondary 4 and 5 will generally not be accepted, in view of the short runway to the national examinations.

Students seeking transfer may complete this online [Transfer Form](https://form.gov.sg/633397664d988800120474a4), with softcopy supporting documents. <br>Shortlisted students may be required to sit for a school placement test and/or attend an interview.
