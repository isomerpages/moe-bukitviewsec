### <center>A very warm welcome to our BVSS Family!</center>

As announced by MOE, Secondary 1 students (2023) are not required to physically report to school on Thursday, 22 December 2022. We look forward to welcoming your child/guardian to our school on the first day of school on Tuesday 3 January 2023.

Parents/Guardians of newly posted Secondary 1 students will receive a welcome message via Parents Gateway (PG) by our Secondary 1 Year Head, Miss Ang Bee Lee. This welcome message will provide details on our orientation programme in 2023.
