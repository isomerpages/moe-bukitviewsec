The class size will be smaller than the usual, approximately 34 students.&nbsp; Students will attend lessons in the form classes for the following subjects: Art, Design &amp; Technology, Character and Citizenship Education, Food and Consumer Education, Music, as well as Physical Education.<br>For the academic subjects, namely English, Mother Tongue Language, Mathematics, Science, and the Humanities, students will be attending lessons based on their subject classes.&nbsp; The subject classes will be organised based on their respective courses at the G1, G2 or G3 levels.</p><p>The common learning experience through the mixed form classes helps to facilitate positive relationships, strengthening the bonds between teachers and students and among peers to establish a strong sense of class identity and belonging to the school community, empowering students to develop a healthy self-concept and grow to the best of their abilities.</p><p>Throughout their secondary school education, students can take subjects at three subject levels, known as G1, G2, G3 (G stands for General), mapped from today's N(T), N(A) and Express standards respectively. Students will have the flexibility adjust their subject levels at appropriate junctures, based on their strengths, interests and learning needs. Students will subsequently access programmes and post-secondary pathways based on their various subjects and subject level combinations.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>PSLE Score</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Posting Group</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Subject Level for Most Subjects</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>4 - 20&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>3</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G3</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>21 and 22</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2 or 3</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G2 or G3</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>23 and 24</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G2</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>25</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>1 or 2</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G1 or G2</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>26 - 30</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>1</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G1</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h4><strong>Subjects at a more demanding Level (MDL)</strong></h4><p>Students who offer most subjects at G1 or G2 are eligible to offer English Language (EL), Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), Mathematics (MA) and Science (SCI) at a more demanding level from the start of S1 if they have performed well in these subjects at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).</p><p></p><p><strong>(a)</strong> Eligibility of students to offer subject(s) at a more demanding level</p><p>The subjects offered are English, Mathematics, Mother Tongue and Science.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Indicative Level of Most Subjects at Start of S1</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>PSLE Standard Grade</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>PSLE Foundation Grade</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Option to offer subject at</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1"><p>G1</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>AL 5 or better</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>-</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G3 / G2</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>AL 6</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>AL A</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G2</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G2</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>AL 5 or better</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>-</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G3</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>SBB Offer Letter for eligible students will be sent via Parents Gateway (PG) between <strong>20 - 21 December 2023.</strong></p><p><strong>Deadline for submission is Wednesday 27 December 2023. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For parents whose children are eligible, and have no PG/Internet access, SBB Offer Letters would be ready for collection during school opening hours.
