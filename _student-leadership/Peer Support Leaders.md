#### MISSION

**_To develop reflective leaders who seek to meet the needs of the school community. We strive to build a peer support system in the school formed by students for students._**  

#### OVERVIEW

The Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) serves as the bridge between students and teachers by providing valuable peer to peer support for their peers through early identification to allow timely interventions. Through various trainings conducted during their years as PSLs, PSLs will be equipped with relevant skills to effectively act as the peer support of the school. Various bonding sessions are organised for the different levels to facilitate bonding between classmates and schoolmates. The Student Games Room was also set up to allow a safe haven for students to hang out after school hours. The PSLs work hand in hand with the Student Council Board and Sports Leaders in various school activities.
