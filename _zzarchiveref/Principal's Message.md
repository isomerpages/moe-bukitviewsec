## Principal's Message

We are 39!

The BVSS Curriculum is anchored on the tenets of Positive Education, namely Positive Relationships, Positive Emotions, Positive Health, Positive Engagement, Positive Accomplishment, and Positive Purpose.
These Positive Education efforts are driven through two pillars of student development – Learning Strategies and Social Skills Development. 

A key feature of the BVSS Curriculum is the provision of multi-modal development opportunities which strive to develop each student’s potential to the maximum. Engagement in STEM is structured to develop 21CC-ready graduands, while confidence, articulate expression, and character are nurtured through the Arts x Values curriculum. A wide range of subject offerings harness students’ passion to learn and grow while an extensive suite of CCAs, Enrichment Programmes, Lifeskills Development, and VIA outreach efforts strengthen students’ resilience, sense of community, and character. Leadership Development and Recognition mould Bukit Viewans into all-rounded, confident persons.

Buttressed by accomplished alumni, an active Parent Support Group, and a dedicated School Advisory Committee, BVSS inspires and enables students to realise their aspirations.

As the BVSS Brand turns 39 this year, we stride forward to nurture every learner, constantly guided by our Mission to remain ‘A dynamic institution that adds value to all by valuing learners, valuing learning and learning values’, and our Motto ‘Care &amp; Share, Achieve &amp; Excel’.
