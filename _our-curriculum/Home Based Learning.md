## Home-Based Learning

In light of the developing COVID-19 situation in Singapore, the school have put in place strict precautionary measures over the past few months to keep our school a safe environment for our students, and to allow our students to continue learning.

With the end of the Circuit Breaker period on 1 June 2020, we will progressively bring students back to school from 2 June 2020 (Term 3), in a careful and safe manner.

For a start, **students from Secondary 4 and 5 will attend school daily from Mondays to Fridays. Students from Secondary 1 to 3 will rotate weekly between Home-Based Learning (HBL) and returning to school for lessons**.

Please refer to the table below for the weekly rotation schedule.

| **Week**  | **In-School**  |  **HBL** |
|---|---|---|
| T3W1  | Secondary 1, 2, 4 & 5  | Secondary 3  |
|  T3W2 | Secondary 3, 4 & 5  | Secondary 1, 2  |
| T3W3  | Secondary 1, 2, 4 & 5  | Secondary 3  |
| T3W4  | Secondary 3, 4 & 5  | Secondary 1, 2  |
|   |   |   |

From Term 3 Week 5, we will work towards bringing all students back to school daily, if the situation permits. MOE will monitor the situation closely and we will inform all parents in due course.

Your child will be provided with instructions on how to access their HBL materials by his/her teachers. If your child requires additional support for HBL such as access to digital devices or internet connection, please alert his/her form teacher, who will be able to advise on alternative arrangements.

HBL need not be confined to e-learning or learning with computers. It can include offline assignments or readings (e.g. readings from textbooks, PDF worksheets)

We seek your understanding that there are differences between learning from home and learning in the classroom setting as follows:

*   The student may determine his/her own pace of learning as he/she is not confined to a physical space and/or closely supervised by the teacher in a classroom.
*   The teacher does not have full control of the learning environment and is unable to intervene spontaneously during the learning process.
*   Students’ learning cannot be monitored and evaluated onsite.

**Home-Based Learning Timetable**

The timetable will be class based to ensure lessons are customised and will be **sent to all parents through Parents Gateway**.
