## Home-Based Learning

Your child will be provided with instructions on how to access their HBL materials by his/her teachers. If your child requires additional support for HBL such as access to digital devices or internet connection, please alert his/her form teacher, who will be able to advise on alternative arrangements.

HBL need not be confined to e-learning or learning with computers. It can include offline assignments or readings (e.g. readings from textbooks, PDF worksheets)

We seek your understanding that there are differences between learning from home and learning in the classroom setting as follows:

*   The student may determine his/her own pace of learning as he/she is not confined to a physical space and/or closely supervised by the teacher in a classroom.
*   The teacher does not have full control of the learning environment and is unable to intervene spontaneously during the learning process.
*   Studentsâ€™ learning cannot be monitored and evaluated onsite.
