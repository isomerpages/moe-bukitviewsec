## Full Subject-Based Banding

Bukit View Secondary School is pleased to be one of the schools selected by the Ministry of Education to implement Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) starting in 2022.

#### Purpose

With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education with many subject bands to better meet our students’ learning needs. This is part of a broader shift in our education system to **recognise the strengths and interests of our children** and **to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life**.

By 2024, secondary schools will have implemented the following aspects of Full SBB:  

 *   Offering Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2,
 *   Offering Elective subjects at a less demanding level for students from the Express stream (Upper Secondary); and
 *   Having mixed form classes in Lower Secondary with the provision of a common curriculum.

#### Full SBB in 2022

| **Aspect of Full SBB**  | **How will this be implemented in BVSS?**  |
|---|---|
|  Offering of Humanities Subjects at a more demanding level for Secondary 2 students | Eligible students from the 2021 Secondary 1 Normal (Academic) cohort who are promoted to the same course in 2022 will be able to offer Geography, History or Literature at a more demanding level. With this increased flexibility in customising our students’ learning experiences, we are better able to recognise their interests and nurture their passion.  <br><br>Students who wish to be considered to offer Geography, History or Literature at a more demanding level will have to meet subject-specific criteria in Secondary 1. They should also possess a positive attitude towards learning and strong commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding level.  |
|  Mixed form classes in Secondary 1 with the provision of a common curriculum | As part of the pilot, our school will implement mixed form classes at Secondary 1. <br><br>**This is applicable to Secondary 1 students entering our school in 2022.**  <br><br>The 2022 cohort of Secondary 1 students will be grouped in mixed form classes, comprising students from all streams. Students will attend lessons in their form classes for the following subjects: Character and Citizenship Education, Music, Physical Education, Art, Design & Technology, as well as Food and Consumer Education.  <br><br>For the academic subjects, namely English, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, Science, and the Humanities, students will be attending lessons based on their subject classes.  The subject classes will be organised based on their respective streams \[N(T), N(A) or Express\]    .  <br><br>The common learning experience through the mixed form classes helps to facilitate positive relationships, strengthening the bonds between teachers and students and among peers to establish a strong sense of class identity and belonging to the school community, empowering students to develop a healthy self-concept and grow to the best of their abilities.  |
| Provision for Express students (Upper Secondary) to offer elective subjects at a less demanding level in Upper Secondary  | From 2021, the school has offered Secondary 3 and Secondary 4 students the option to study one of the following elective subjects at the Normal (Academic) level:<br><br>*   Additional Mathematic<br>*   Full Humanities: Literature in English<br>*   Design & Technology<br>*   Principles of Accounts <br><br>This is to allow our students to pursue their passion and interest in an additional subject and/or to build a stronger foundation in subjects for their tertiary education while calibrating their current academic load. |
