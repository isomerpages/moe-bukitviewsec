#### C-Quest – A Mobile App Game to Promote Conversations About Cyber Wellness Between Parents and Children

“Parents play a critical role in shaping their children’s values, as well as in guiding their online behaviour, and monitoring their computer use. Through playing the game with their children, MOE hopes that the App will serve as a tool to encourage conversations between parents and their children on cyber wellness.”  
Mr Wong Siew Hoong Deputy Director-General of Education (Curriculum)  
  
Parents can now download a new mobile game app, C-Quest, and have conversations on cyber wellness with their children. Developed by the Ministry of Education and **targeted at parents with children aged 10 to 14**, C-Quest is specially designed to facilitate meaningful parent-child conversations on their online experiences. Through the game, students will also **learn to be safe, respectful, and responsible users of Information and Communication Technology** (ICT).

For parents without smartphones, a browser-based version is accessible via this link.  
  
C-Quest, in facilitating conversation between parents and their children, complements the Cyber Wellness curriculum in schools, where cyber wellness based on the principles of “**Respect for Self and Others**” and “**Safe and Responsible Use**” of technology are taught through Citizenship and Character Education (CCE) to reinforce the **positive values** and **social emotional competencies needed for our students to navigate the cyber space skilfully and safely**.
