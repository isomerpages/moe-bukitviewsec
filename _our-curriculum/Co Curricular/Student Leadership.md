<h2>Student Leadership</h2>
<h4><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></h4>
<p>At Bukit View Secondary School, student leadership is more than a position—it
is a journey of purpose, growth, and service. The Student Leaders’ Council
(SLC) spearheads student-led initiatives that shape a caring, inclusive,
and values-driven school culture.</p>
<p>Our student leaders are empowered to lead with empathy, act with integrity,
and serve with heart—helping every Bukit Viewan to thrive in our shared
commitment to Building Vistas and Sowing Success.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>VISION</strong></h4>
<p>Our student leadership programme is grounded in the belief that every
Student Leader plays a vital role in strengthening the heartbeat of the
school. We envision our leaders to be:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Advocates and champions of school values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creators of a positive and inclusive school culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging and empowering their peers to contribute meaningfully to a thriving
school life</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4><strong>STUDENT LEADERS CORE IDENTITY</strong></h4>
<p>Every Bukit Viewan Student Leader is anchored in a shared identity shaped
by three leadership ideals. These identities form the cornerstone of our
leadership development efforts.</p>
<p>We believe that every Student Leader is a:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Role Model - </strong>who inspires peers to achieve and excel
through their actions and character</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Servant Leader - </strong>who serves and uplifts others to build
a community that cares and shares</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Courageous Advocate - </strong>who speaks up for what is right,
upholds discipline, and champions respect and responsibility</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These identities dovetail closely with our school’s vision of developing <strong>Engaged Learners, Empathetic Citizens, and Ethical Advocates</strong>.</p>

<h4><strong>STUDENT LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT </strong></h4>
<p>At Bukit View Secondary, leadership is a skill nurtured through purpose,
reflection, and practice. Grounded in our school’s vision, our programme
develops Student Leaders who are values-driven, self-aware, and action-oriented.</p>
<p>We achieve this through:</p>
<p><strong>Progressive Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>From class committees to the Student Leaders’ Council, students are given
increasing levels of responsibility and platforms to lead.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection and Self-Appraisal</strong>
</p>
<p>Student Leaders regularly assess their growth through self-reflection
and guided feedback, deepening their awareness and commitment to lead with
purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Identity Anchor</strong>
</p>
<p>The identities of Role Model, Servant Leader, and Courageous Advocate—sets
clear expectations for leadership behaviour and growth.</p>
<p>This structured, reflective approach ensures that every student leader
grows in character, confidence, and capacity to serve the school community.</p>
