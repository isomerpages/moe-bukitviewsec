<h1><strong>VALUES-IN ACTION@BVSS</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Nurturing Empathetic Citizens &amp; Ethical Advocates</strong></h2>
<p>At Bukit View Sec Sch, our Values in Action (VIA) programme is a cornerstone
of character and citizenship education, aligned closely with our vision
to nurture empathetic citizens and ethical advocates. Through meaningful
and sustained community involvement, our students learn to see the world
through the eyes of others, act with compassion, and stand up for what
is right. VIA empowers them to take ownership of real-world issues, develop
a sense of responsibility, and grow into thoughtful individuals who serve
with heart and integrity.</p>
<p><strong>OUR APPROACH</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>üß† Learn ‚Üí ü§ù Serve ‚Üí üí≠ Reflect</strong>
</p>
<p>Students begin by learning about community needs, then serve meaningfully,
and reflect deeply on their growth and impact.</p>
<p>Through these programmes, students are encouraged to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Identify needs in their chosen sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan and execute meaningful activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflect on their learning and impact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every activity is a stepping stone in shaping them into <em>empathetic citizens</em> who
not only care, but also <em>ethical advocates</em> who take informed action
for the good of others.</p>
