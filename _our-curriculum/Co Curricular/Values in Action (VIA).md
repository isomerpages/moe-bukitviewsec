<p><strong>Nurturing Empathetic Citizens &amp; Ethical Advocates</strong>
</p>
<p>At Bukit View Sec Sch, our Values in Action (VIA) programme is a cornerstone
of character and citizenship education, aligned closely with our vision
to nurture empathetic citizens and ethical advocates. Through meaningful
and sustained community involvement, our students learn to see the world
through the eyes of others, act with compassion, and stand up for what
is right. VIA empowers them to take ownership of real-world issues, develop
a sense of responsibility, and grow into thoughtful individuals who serve
with heart and integrity</p>
