<p>At Bukit View Secondary School, we are committed to creating a caring
and enabling environment where every student feels safe, supported, and
empowered to be their best. We believe that student well-being is the foundation
for learning and growth, and we strive to help all students flourish holistically.</p>
<p>Our approach to student well-being is anchored in a whole-school community
effort, guided by the principles of Positive Education and MOE Character
and Citizenship Education (CCE) 2021 framework. We work closely with all
stakeholders, students, staff and parents, to nurture an inclusive and
affirming schooling environment and culture.</p>
<p>Key areas of focus include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Promoting positive behaviours and mental well-being through structured
programmes that build resilience and emotional strength.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing clear and supportive structures that foster meaningful relationships
and a sense of belonging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partnering with parents to ensure continuity of care, and to support the
holistic development of every student.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Building Social-Emotional Competence</strong>
</p>
<p>We aim to strengthen students’ social-emotional competencies through a
vibrant learning environment and rich co-curricular experiences. These
skills are essential for well-being and character development, helping
students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop healthy self-identities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognise and manage their emotions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate empathy and care for others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build positive relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate challenges and make responsible decisions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These competencies form the foundation for confidence, personal effectiveness,
and well-being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Fostering Positive Relationships</strong>
</p>
<p>Positive relationships are at the heart of a strong school community and
central to student well-being. Supportive teacher-student and peer relationships
build trust, increase self-esteem, and enhance students’ connection to
school.</p>
<p>We prioritise relationship-building through deliberate structures such
as Form Teachers’ Time and Form Teacher-Led Time, which create space for
conversation, bonding, and connection. When students feel seen, heard,
and valued, they are more likely to participate actively and positively
in school life.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering Peer Support</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe every student has the capacity to positively influence their
peers. This belief underpins our peer support structures that promote a
caring and inclusive school culture.</p>
<p>At the core of our peer support system are Peer Support Leaders (PSLs)—six
trained student leaders per class who serve as attentive observers and
connectors within their classroom communities. Trained by our school counsellors
in peer helping, active listening, and basic counselling skills, PSLs also
attend termly check-ins with teacher mentors from our Student Well-being
Committee. These sessions deepen their skills and assist them in playing
an active role in providing guidance, and assistance to their peers.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing School Connectedness</strong>
</p>
<p>To further strengthen student engagement, we offer the GEAR-UP Programme,
which supports student well-being by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Building positive relationships with peers and adults</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing safe and supportive environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fostering a strong sense of belonging</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The programme includes befriending and mentoring by trusted adults, as
well as interest-based and student-led activities. A hallmark of GEAR-UP
is its student-led workshops, where students share their passions, develop
self-directed learning, and build confidence through peer teaching, while
also forging stronger peer connections.</p>

<p><strong>Celebrating Positive Character</strong>
</p>
<p>We affirm and celebrate character through a comprehensive recognition
framework that builds confidence, nurtures a growth mindset, and encourages
personal excellence:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Model Student Award – for exemplary conduct</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good Deed Award – for acts of kindness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most Gritty Award – for perseverance through challenges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most Zesty Award – for enthusiasm and positivity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most Grateful Award – for active participation in school life</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These awards reflect our school’s emphasis on gratitude, resilience, positivity,
and active citizenship.</p>
<p>Through our holistic approach to student well-being, we aim to nurture
a school environment where every student feels seen, supported, and inspired
to thrive. Together as educators, parents, and peers, we create the conditions
for our students to flourish in school and beyond.</p>
