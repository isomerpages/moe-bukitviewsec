#### Key Programmes

**Code for Fun for Secondary 1** <br>
This programme is a set of hands-on-mind-on lessons that reinforce the learning of STEM concepts in the classroom. The use of M5GO Microcontrollers in learning enables the student to “see, feel, touch, control, and imagine”.

**Smart City Project for Secondary 2** <br>
In Sec 2, students built on what they have learnt in Sec 1 Joules.&nbsp; Students learnt how to interface micro:bit with sensor:bit and other external input and output devices. The students then apply what they have learnt in creating their smart cities projects.&nbsp;

**Enrichment for Students Taking Computer Applications**<br>
Secondary 1 students learnt how to code using an intuitive, block-based development environment. In Scratch students control a canvas of sprites using code to create projects ranging from short story animations to games. Implementing these fun projects requires students to put on their thinking caps, and work on logical problems to orchestrate what happens on the screen. Students also picked up coding constructs like loops and variables.



Secondary 2 students gained essential programming skills while engaged in fun activities using Minecraft, a highly popular video game. Microsoft has released an Education Edition which integrates a coding editor that supports block-based programming languages. This makes Minecraft a perfect environment for teaching computational thinking.

**Enrichment for Computing students** <br>
Students programmed on the micro:bit micro-controller using microPython on the mu Editor. The micro: bit is a programmable microcontroller that serves to introduce coding, electronics, and hands-on digital making. Students created “starry night” simulations on the LED display and various games including Reaction Game, Simon Says and Snap the Dot.
