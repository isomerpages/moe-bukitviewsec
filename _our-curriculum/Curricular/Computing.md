<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>To provide students with Computational Thinking skills to participate
in a rapidly changing technological environment.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Key Achievements and Activities</h4>
<p><strong>Code for Fun for Secondary 1</strong> 
<br>This programme is a set of hands-on-mind-on lessons that reinforce the
learning of STEM concepts in the classroom. The use of M5GO Microcontrollers
in learning enables the student to “see, feel, touch, control, and imagine”.</p>

<p><strong>Smart City Project for Secondary 2</strong> 
<br>In Sec 2, students built on what they have learnt in Sec 1 Joules.&nbsp;
Students learnt how to interface micro:bit with sensor:bit and other external
input and output devices. The students then apply what they have learnt
in creating their smart cities projects.</p>
<p><strong>Enrichment for Students Taking Computer Applications</strong>
<br>In the Scratch workshop, Secondary Two students dived into the world of
interactive game creation using the Scratch platform. They brought their
ideas to life by building engaging projects like a movement-chasing game
and a thrilling fruit machine game. Along the way, they gained valuable
hands-on experience in game development, sharpening their coding skills
and unleashing their creativity.</p>
<p>The Secondary Three students participated in a Tello drones workshop,
where they learned the basics of drone operation, including First-Person
View (FPV) flying and programming drones for autonomous flight using the
DroneBlocks app. The workshop concluded with an exciting course challenge
that allowed students to test and showcase their drone control skills.</p>

<p><strong>Enrichment for Computing students</strong> 
<br>Our drone enrichment workshop for Secondary Three Computing students provided
students with a hands-on introduction to drone technology and programming.
Participants learned the basics of the Tello drone, setting up a development
environment using Python and the djitellopy library. By the end of the
workshop, they had practiced essential commands to control drone movement,
programming the drones to take off, land, and navigate simple flight patterns.
The experience also introduced students to AI tasks, such as face tracking,
where they successfully programmed the drones to autonomously follow a
face. This workshop equipped students with foundational skills in drone
operation and programming, sparking interest in further exploration of
drone technology.</p>

<p><strong>Notable achievements</strong>
</p>
<p>Three of our Secondary 4 students (Moiz from 4G, Rui Zhi from 4F, and
Shawn from 4F) embarked on a learning journey to BSM Singapore to explore
the maritime industry. During this experience, they participated in the
selection process for the Global Online Maritime Innovation Hackathon,
jointly organized by Junior Achievement and BSM. Out of 20 teams, Bukit
View Secondary was one of four teams selected to represent Singapore. Partnered
with students from Cyprus, they worked together online to develop a solution
for the challenge statement: “Develop an innovative business idea on how
AI can transform the work of maritime professionals for the better.” We
are proud to announce that the BVSS-Cyprus team emerged as the winner of
the challenge. Their winning idea was a mental health wellness platform
tailored for seafarers, using AI and telehealth to support mental health
through screening and identifying those needing assistance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>ICTXPLORE was a two-day workshop at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP), featuring
competitive elements in Data Science, Cybersecurity, and Digital Forensics.
A total of 15 students participated during the September school holidays.
One of our teams, consisting of Janelle Ong (4D), Ye Wen Kai (3G), Lee
Jung Kye (2C), and Joben Ong (2C), secured third place.</p>

<p>The Animation and Game Making Competition, organized by MOE, invites secondary
schools offering Computer Applications to submit their best Secondary 2
animation and Secondary 3 game to compete with top entries from other schools.
Our Secondary 2 representative, Sharlyn Ong Jia Yi, achieved the prestigious
Platinum award, which is given to the top three of the ten Gold awardees.
To receive this honor, students undergo an interview conducted by representatives
from NIE and MOE.</p>
