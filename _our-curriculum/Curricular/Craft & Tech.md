<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p>Craft &amp; Technology covers four subjects: Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T),
Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS), Art, and Music. The curriculum is designed
to meet the needs of students facing demands of the 21st century. D&amp;T
and F&amp;N are coursework and skill-based and students are required to
solve real-life problems as part of their tasks. In Art and Music, students
are exposed to alternative approaches and experiences to broaden their
mind as they learn creative techniques in their art and music making activities.
To do well, they need to think critically and creatively to produce innovative
solutions as well as original compositions. Through this open-ended experiential
learning process, students learn the skills to face challenges of an uncertain
future. The curriculum also include the use of ICT for better engagement
in student learning eg Photoshop and Pinterest for Art, Google Sketch-up
and Google Classroom for D&amp;T, Kahoot and Mentimeter for NFS, and Garage
Band for Music.</p>
<p><strong>Pedagogy</strong>
<br>Different pedagogies are used to deliver the curriculum. They include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Coursework based learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborative learning and Self-directed learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critical and Inventive Thinking eg. Inquiry Learning, Design Thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiential learning</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We aim to excite and engage our learners through authentic learning experiences
and encourage them to cultivate an appreciation and zest for their craft.
This is guided by our 3E approach of Excite, Engage and Excel.</p>

<h4>Assessment</h4>
<p>Being coursework based subjects, the overall assessment is weighted towards
the coursework component. Depending on the different levels and streams,
the final assessment may include up to 70% of weighting for the coursework.
This works towards meeting the following weighting criteria at the GCE
national examination:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>D&amp;T: 30% written paper, 70% coursework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>F&amp;N: 40% written paper, 60% coursework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Art: 40% drawing paper, 60% coursework</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assessment for learning (AFL) is employed to help students learn effectively
through the use of multiple bite-sized assessments such as quizzes. These
help to identify students’ weaknesses and what teachers can do to help
students address their areas of concern.</p>
<p><strong>MUSIC</strong>
<br>Students would be able to experience a variety of music making opportunities
with MTV routines to bring in authentic learning in music lessons. Through
creative music making in the music classroom in various mediums, students
would develop lifelong music skills and Socio-Emotional Competencies through
the practice of Musicking. With reference to the 21st Century Competencies
and Student Outcomes (Ministry Of Education, 2018), students would collaborate
with each other to learn from one other in a school community setting.</p>
<p>Students would have the opportunity to experience the following:</p>
<p>1 . Instrumental learning (Ukulele, Guitar, Drums, Keyboard)
<br>2 . Local songs module
<br>3 . Pop band module
<br>4 . Opportunities to be coached by actual practitioners</p>
<p>Music is assessed twice a year. Assessments include research work, individual
instrumental assessments, ensemble work and listening tests. Weightage
for each component vary by year.</p>
