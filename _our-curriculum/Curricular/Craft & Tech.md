#### Curriculum

Craft & Technology covers four subjects: Design & Technology (D&T), Nutrition & Food Science (NFS), Art, and Music. The curriculum is designed to meet the needs of students facing demands of the 21st century. D&T and F&N are coursework and skill-based and students are required to solve real-life problems as part of their tasks. In Art and Music, students are exposed to alternative approaches and experiences to broaden their mind as they learn creative techniques in their art and music making activities. To do well, they need to think critically and creatively to produce innovative solutions as well as original compositions. Through this open-ended experiential learning process, students learn the skills to face challenges of an uncertain future. The curriculum also include the use of ICT for better engagement in student learning eg Photoshop and Pinterest for Art, Google Sketch-up and Google Classroom for D&T, Kahoot and Mentimeter for NFS, and Garage Band for Music.

**Pedagogy**<br>
Different pedagogies are used to deliver the curriculum. They include:

*   Coursework based learning
*   Collaborative learning and Self-directed learning
*   Critical and Inventive Thinking eg. Inquiry Learning, Design Thinking
*   Experiential learning

We aim to excite and engage our learners through authentic learning experiences and encourage them to cultivate an appreciation and zest for their craft. This is guided by our 3E approach of Excite, Engage and Excel.
