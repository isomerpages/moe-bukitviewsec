#### Curriculum

The Science curriculum in Bukit View is designed to inculcate students with relevant knowledge, skills and values through meaningful and engaging learning experiences.

<img src="/images/sci framework.jpg" style="width:40%">

Our department aim to:  <br>
 1 \.  cultivate student’s perception of Science as a collective effort and a way of thinking rather than just a body of facts;<br>
 2 \.  engage students in Science-related issues that concern their lives the society and the environment; and<br>
 3 \.  help students develop the domains that are integral to the conduct of Science inquiry.

We will achieve that by:  <br>
 1 \.  teaching Science as inquiry;<br>
 2 \.  allowing students, through inquiry, to acquire knowledge and understanding of their natural and physical world based on their own investigations, apply the skills and processes of inquiry and develop attitude and values that are essential to the practice of Science; and<br>
 3 \.  nurturing students who enjoy Science and value science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.

Students should be able to  <br>
 1 \.  use scientific skills in everyday life,<br>
 2 \.  make informed decisions related to Science and technology,<br>
 3 \.  engage in meaningful scientific discourse with others e.g. social and moral issues related to advances in Science,<br>
 4 \.  contribute to the progress of Science knowledge e.g. working with scientists on research projects,<br>
 5 \.  understand the place of humanity in the natural world,<br>
 6 \.  demonstrate care and concern for the environment,<br>
 7 \.  have an open mind and value science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.
