#### Curriculum

The Science curriculum in Bukit View is designed to inculcate students with relevant knowledge, skills and values through meaningful and engaging learning experiences.

<img src="/images/sci framework.jpg" style="width:40%">

Our department aim to:  <br>
 1 \.  cultivate student’s perception of Science as a collective effort and a way of thinking rather than just a body of facts;<br>
 2 \.  engage students in Science-related issues that concern their lives the society and the environment; and<br>
 3 \.  help students develop the domains that are integral to the conduct of Science inquiry.

We will achieve that by:  <br>
 1 \.  teaching Science as inquiry;<br>
 2 \.  allowing students, through inquiry, to acquire knowledge and understanding of their natural and physical world based on their own investigations, apply the skills and processes of inquiry and develop attitude and values that are essential to the practice of Science; and<br>
 3 \.  nurturing students who enjoy Science and value science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.

Students should be able to  <br>
 1 \.  use scientific skills in everyday life,<br>
 2 \.  make informed decisions related to Science and technology,<br>
 3 \.  engage in meaningful scientific discourse with others e.g. social and moral issues related to advances in Science,<br>
 4 \.  contribute to the progress of Science knowledge e.g. working with scientists on research projects,<br>
 5 \.  understand the place of humanity in the natural world,<br>
 6 \.  demonstrate care and concern for the environment,<br>
 7 \.  have an open mind and value science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.

#### Pedagogy
   
**Inquiry-Based Learning**<br>
The department provide opportunities for students to enjoy Science and value science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world through processes of inquiry.  

 *   Interdisciplinary learning e.g. ALP – JOULES Programme
 *   ICT skills through use of Google ChromeBooks and Google suite of applications, Scratch™ animation
 *   Science Awareness Week
 *   Enrichment programmes e.g. AEMs, NUS Chemistry Week, Learning Journey to Lee Kong Chian National History Museum, The Star Lecture

**Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**<br>
With globalisation and rapid technological advancements, we are moving into a new phase of development as a nation where the emphasis is on learning throughout life. The ALP has been initiated to better prepare students to meet the demands of this new phase. With an emphasis on the application of thinking skills, connecting knowledge across subject disciplines and applying these in real-life settings, ALPs help every student appreciate the relevance and value of what they learn in class. This will provide stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge and skills. Our ALP is a collaboration with STEM Inc. which is the educational unit of the Singapore Science Centre.  

 *   Sec 1: Clean energy and the science of designing a solar car
 *   Sec 2: Water testing and water robot

**Thinking HATS (High Ability Talent in Science) Programme**<br>
This talent development programme is developed based on the E2K (Singapore) Science curriculum in collaboration with Gifted Education Branch (GEB), MOE to stretch the ability of our high achievers in Science.

The programme aims to:  

 *   develop skills for scientific inquiry,
 *   encourage creative and critical thinking,
 *   use engaging storylines and scenarios to provide authentic context for the mastery of scientific concepts, and
 *   promote collaboration and discussions in teams.
