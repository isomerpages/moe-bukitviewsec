<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Creative Thinker, Passionate Learner, with a spirit of scientific inquiry
and empathy for man and nature.</p>

<h4>Mission&nbsp;</h4>
<p>To inculcate pupils with relevant knowledge, skills and values through
providing meaningful and engaging experiences.</p>

<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p>The Science curriculum in Bukit View is designed to inculcate students
with relevant knowledge, skills and values through meaningful and engaging
learning experiences.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:40%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sci framework.jpg">
</div>
<p>Our department aim to:
<br>1 . cultivate student’s perception of Science as a collective effort and
a way of thinking rather than just a body of facts;
<br>2 . engage students in Science-related issues that concern their lives
the society and the environment; and
<br>3 . help students develop the domains that are integral to the conduct
of Science inquiry.</p>
<p>We will achieve that by:
<br>1 . teaching Science as inquiry;
<br>2 . allowing students, through inquiry, to acquire knowledge and understanding
of their natural and physical world based on their own investigations,
apply the skills and processes of inquiry and develop attitude and values
that are essential to the practice of Science; and
<br>3 . nurturing students who enjoy Science and value science as an important
tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.</p>
<p>Students should be able to
<br>1 . use scientific skills in everyday life,
<br>2 . make informed decisions related to Science and technology,
<br>3 . engage in meaningful scientific discourse with others e.g. social
and moral issues related to advances in Science,
<br>4 . contribute to the progress of Science knowledge e.g. working with
scientists on research projects,
<br>5 . understand the place of humanity in the natural world,
<br>6 . demonstrate care and concern for the environment,
<br>7 . have an open mind and value science as an important tool in helping
them explore their natural and physical world.</p>

<p><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong>
<br>With globalisation and rapid technological advancements, we are moving
into a new phase of development as a nation where the emphasis is on learning
throughout life. The ALP has been initiated to better prepare students
to meet the demands of this new phase. With an emphasis on the application
of thinking skills, connecting knowledge across subject disciplines and
applying these in real-life settings, ALPs help every student appreciate
the relevance and value of what they learn in class. This will provide
stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge and skills. Our ALP
is a collaboration with STEM Inc. which is the educational unit of the
Singapore Science Centre.</p>

<p><strong>STEM Overseas Learning Trip to Hong Kong</strong>
<br>This study trips aim to provide our pupils with the opportunities to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>generate greater awareness and interest in the fields of Science, Technology
(Computing), Engineering and Mathematics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a global mindset in students by helping them to understand how
STEM education is developing in other countries around the world and how
Singapore can continue to stay relevant in this area of development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend pupils’ learning and experiences beyond the classroom by arranging
for them to interact with local students and develop in our students the
21st century competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural skills
and sensitivities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>21 Secondary Two and Three students and 6 teachers visited Hong Kong (HK)
from 10 to 14 June 2018 to deepen their learning in the fields of Science,
Technology (Computing), Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) and the Environment.
3 teachers also presented a paper at the HK Computational Thinking and
Education International Conference 2018. The trip was an enriching and
eye-opening learning experience for the students.</p>
