<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Creative Thinker, Passionate Learner, with a spirit of scientific inquiry
and empathy for man and nature.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Mission&nbsp;</h4>
<p>To inculcate pupils with relevant knowledge, skills and values through
providing meaningful and engaging experiences.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p>The Science curriculum in Bukit View is aligned to the MOE Science Curriculum
Framework (Figure 1) which encapsulates the thrust of science education
in Singapore, providing students with a strong foundation in science for
life, future learning, citizenry and work.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture1.png">
</div>
<p>Our department aim to:
<br>1. cultivate student’s perception of Science as a collective effort and
a way of thinking rather than just a body of facts;
<br>2 . engage students in Science-related issues that concern their lives
the society and the environment; and
<br>3 . help students develop the domains that are integral to the conduct
of Science inquiry.</p>
<p>We will achieve that by:
<br>1. teaching Science as inquiry;
<br>2. allowing students, through inquiry, to acquire knowledge and understanding
of their natural and physical world based on their own investigations,
apply the skills and processes of inquiry and develop attitude and values
that are essential to the practice of Science; and
<br>3. nurturing students who enjoy Science and value science as an important
tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.</p>
<p>Students should be able to
<br>1. use scientific skills in everyday life,
<br>2. make informed decisions related to Science and technology,
<br>3. engage in meaningful scientific discourse with others e.g. social and
moral issues related to advances in Science,
<br>4. contribute to the progress of Science knowledge e.g. working with scientists
on research projects,
<br>5. understand the place of humanity in the natural world,
<br>6. demonstrate care and concern for the environment,
<br>7. have an open mind and value science as an important tool in helping
them explore their natural and physical world.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary Science Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>Guided by the Science Curriculum Framework, the G2/G3 LSS curriculum is
underpinned by five themes, which is aligned to the Primary Science Syllabus.
These themes arise from CoreIdeas and Practices of Science, and provide
the foundational concepts that students need for the disciplinary sciences
(biology, chemistry and physics) at upper secondary. The five themes in
the G2/G3 LSS syllabuses are: <em>Scientific Endeavour, Diversity, Models, Interactions and Systems</em>.</p>
<p>The G1 Lower Secondary Science syllabus is structured into an introductory
topic on <em>Laboratory Measurements and Procedures</em> and three modules,
namely <em>Machines Around Us (I), Our Environment, and Our Body and Health (I)</em>,
that are situated in authentic contexts students can relate to.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes and Achievements</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Talent Development</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Students who offer Pure Sciences in Upper Secondary are given opportunities
to participate in the following Junior Science Olympiad competitions and
they regularly achieve results placing them in the top 20% of their cohort.</p>
<p><strong>(A) Singapore Junior Chemistry Olympiad (SJChO)</strong>
</p>
<p>SJChO provides a platform for upper sec students to challenge themselves
in their chemical knowledge and skills. It seeks to promote the excitement
in learning and doing Chemistry as well as to identify and develop chemistry
talents. SJChO is organized by Singapore National Institute of Chemistry
with support from the Ministry of Education (MOE).</p>

<p><strong>(E) NXplorers 2.0 Journey</strong>
</p>
<p>NXplorers 2.0 Journey is championed by Science Centre Singapore and Shell
Singapore. It is a platform for young people to develop sustainable solutions
to food, water and energy challenges. Through the process, students learn
systems thinking, scenario planning, and develop change management skills
- all highly relevant skill sets that inspire and equip students to be
positive agents of change.</p>
<p>Only 20 teams were selected as finalists and awarded a <strong>Seed Fund of SGD 2500</strong> to
build a working prototype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bukit View team was <strong>one of a few teams invited </strong>by
the organiser of <strong>STEM Teacher FeST</strong> to showcase their project
- <strong>New Epic Rainwater Device Specialists (NERDS</strong>) at the
inaugural event where the GOH was the DGE. The organiser commented that
the idea of using rainwater to generate electricity and water crop is very <strong>innovative</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><u>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – a multi-disciplinary approach to learning Science</u></strong>
</p>
<p>With globalisation and rapid technological advancements, we are moving
into a new phase of development as a nation where the emphasis is on learning
throughout life. The ALP has been initiated to better prepare students
to meet the demands of this new phase. With an emphasis on the application
of thinking skills, connecting knowledge across subject disciplines and
applying these in real-life settings, ALPs help every student appreciate
the relevance and value of what they learn in class. This will provide
stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge and skills. Our ALP
is a collaboration with STEM Inc. which is the educational unit of the
Singapore Science Centre.</p>
<p>Sec 1: Clean energy and the science of designing a solar car</p>
<p>Sec 2: Designing solutions for future Smart Cities; Water testing using
water robots</p>
