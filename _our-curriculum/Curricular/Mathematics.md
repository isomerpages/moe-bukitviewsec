## Mathematics

<img src="/images/MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT.jpg" style="width:85%">

The Mathematics Department believes that everyone can do Mathematics. No matter what the starting point is, our teachers ensure high expectations for all by supporting and empowering students to reach their potential. Our curriculum and programmes are designed to develop problem-solving disposition, digital literacy, and self-directedness. We provide opportunities for students to develop critical thinking in order to make sense of the disciplinarity of Mathematics, to see connections and applications to the real world. Bukit Viewans develop mathematical confidence and competence, gaining understanding on why Mathematics is important and relevant in their lives.

#### Key Programmes and Achievements

###### <u>Mathematical Modelling Projects</u>

Secondary 3 students worked on a real-world problem “Bungee-Jumping”. Using data collated and Excel or Desmos, they were tasked to figure out a mathematical model for the given problem.Mathematical modelling (MM) uses mathematical approaches to understand and make decisions about real-world problems and is a powerful tool to nurture necessary mathematical thinking skills.

###### <u>S1 Amazing Race - “Math Mission: It’s Possible”</u>

Secondary 1 students were tasked to solve mathematics problems that were placed around the school. Once solved, they will obtain clues to crack a code. Learning Experience (LE) focuses on learning as a process rather than an outcome and is student-centric, allowing a student to do something as part of his/her learning. LE contributes to the development of process (cognitive and metacognitive) as well as 21st century competencies.

###### <u>Flipped Learning Resources</u>

Our teachers are competent in many ICT tools and platforms that enable students to be empowered in their learning. We leverage on google classroom for resources, assignments and announcement, Kahoot and Quizziz for Assessment for Learning (AfL), video lessons recordings to complement learning tasks, DESMOS and SLS functions that enable self-directed and collaborative learning. The department has also incorporated Success Criteria and Self-Assessment checklist for each topic so that students can regulate and monitor their own learning. ‘Test My Understanding’ (TMU) assignments are also a novel way to carry out homework, one that empowers students and guides them to the next step.

###### <u>Innovation</u>

The AlgeCards is a set of manipulatives developed from a Lesson Study project by the department in collaboration with Assistant Professor Dr Leong Yew Hoong from NIE-MME in 2009. It has been used school-wide in the teaching of algebraic concepts. Through this project, the department has developed ready-made lesson packages customised to our students’ learning needs.

###### <u>Student Achievements</u>

Selected students took part in the Singapore and Asian Schools Mathematics Olympiad (SASMO) and Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO) Competition, 2 students achieved the Silver award, 7 achieved the Bronze award and 10 were given Honourable Mention for SASMO.  1 student achieved the Bronze award and 2 Honourable Mentions for SMO.

#### Principles of Accounts

In today’s business climate, accounting is about more than just crunching numbers. Our students not only acquire knowledge and understanding of fundamental accounting concepts, principles and procedures in the context of business aims and activities, they also develop the understanding of the role of accounting in providing an information system for monitoring and decision making.  
  
Students will develop skills and attitudes that are pertinent to the workforce such as accuracy, orderliness, logical thought and an appreciation of professional ethics.
