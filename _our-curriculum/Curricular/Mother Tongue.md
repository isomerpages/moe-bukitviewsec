#### Mission & Core Curriculum

Mother Tongue Language learning provides a link to the heritage of students’ ethnic groups, and anchors their identity in the global world. At Bukit View, we deepen students’ understanding and heighten their appreciation for the Mother Tongue languages and culture, while equipping them with effective language and communication skills for the future global economy  
  

#### Pedagogy

In line with MOE’s initiative on school-based curriculum design, the Mother Tongue Department has customized our syllabus sequencing, teaching resources and enrichment programmes to further enhance student learning.

Core Programme

*   Enhancing students’ critical thinking ability in reading and comprehension through Making Thinking Visible Routines.
*   Improving students’ oratorical and analytical skills through the use of ICT platforms such as SLS.
*   Cultivating students’ habit of reading through reflective and critical reading of selected reading passages and newspaper articles.
*   Culturally enriching experiences for students under the Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme.

The department actively leverages on various ICT platforms such as Google Classroom and Student Learning Spaces (SLS) to enhance students’ learning experiences in mastering the respective Mother Tongue Languages.

**Flexibility of Choice – Offer to read Higher Mother Tongue and Out-of-Stream Subject**

Students who are keen to read the High Mother Tongue Language subjects can approach their subject teachers for consideration and application. All Sec 2 Normal Academic students who have performed above expectations and who have consistently very good results in the Mother Tongue Languages will be considered for reading the subject at a high level. This is to facilitate students ‘ interest and passion, as well as to stretch the students’ learning.
