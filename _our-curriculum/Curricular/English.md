<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p>A good command of English is vital in this shrinking interconnected global
village. The English curriculum recognises and leverages on the usefulness
of the language to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>fully appreciate another’s ideas and sentiments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly express one’s thoughts and feelings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make an impact on others by communicating fluently and persuasively</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Literature cultivates empathy and nurture one’s sensitivity
towards human emotions and experience, while the Learning for Life Programme
(LLP) inculcates values through drama.</p>
<p>The robust curriculum helps students to do well in school, post-secondary
education and life.</p>
<h4>Pedagogy</h4>
<p>Enhancing English Learning and Teaching is a key approach developed in
partnership with the Ministry of Education. This approach employs four
teaching strategies:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Retelling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process Writing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reciprocal Teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creative, Critical and Inventive Thinking</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students experience student-centric lessons and take ownership of their
learning. Information and Communications Technology is harnessed to further
both self-directed and collaborative learning. Visible Thinking strategies
are taught to enhance thinking disposition to enable better learning outcome.</p>
<p>Differentiated Instruction is another key approach to maximise the potential
of all students. Customising lessons and opportunities for students of
similar ability ensures strong language development.</p>
<h4>Collaboration</h4>
<p>Enhancing English Learning and Teaching is a partnership with MOE’s English
Language and Literature Branch. On top of being one of the pioneering schools,
Bukit View Secondary School teachers were featured in videos for training
teachers nationwide and in lesson study cycles culminating in an article
for Northstar Online Publication.</p>
<p>The National KidsRead programme sees scores of students collaborating
with the National Library Board to read stories aloud to primary one and
two pupils. This nationwide reading programme promotes a love for reading
and cultivates good reading habits among young Singaporeans.</p>
