<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>We nurture students to be proficient in the English Language, who can
wield it effectively to achieve desired outcome.</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>To provide the opportunity and platform to nurture empathetic communicators,
discerning readers and creative enquirer.</p>
<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p>A good command of English is vital in this shrinking interconnected global
village. The English curriculum recognises and leverages on the usefulness
of the language to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>fully appreciate another’s ideas and sentiments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly express one’s thoughts and feelings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make an impact on others by communicating fluently and persuasively</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Literature cultivates empathy and nurture one’s sensitivity
towards human emotions and experience, while the Learning for Life Programme
(LLP) inculcates values through drama.</p>
<p>The robust curriculum helps students to do well in school, post-secondary
education and life.</p>
<h4>Pedagogy</h4>
<p>To enhance the teaching and learning of the English Language, the department
employs a range of pedagogical approaches. These include Process Writing,
developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Visible Thinking
routines, and both self-directed and collaborative learning supported by
Information and Communications Technology (ICT). We also emphasize peer
assessment to promote metacognition and encourage the responsible use of
Artificial Intelligence to support learning. Additionally, we leverage
feedback to drive assessment for learning.</p>
<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>EL and Lit Week</strong>
</p>
<p>Crafting witty captions for interesting photographs, composing Haiku to
romanticise a scene, or knotting the tongue over Tongue Twisters, our students
relish the array of out-of-syllabus activities specifically crafted for
the English Language and Literature Week. It is another platform to showcase
their proficiency, hone their skills and experience the joy of learning.
At times, avid readers also gamely step up to share about the books they
have read with their schoolmates.</p>

<p><strong>Mentoring Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Graduating students who require coaching in English Language are identified
and assigned English teachers to mentor and monitor their progress. This
weekly programme caters to individual learning needs where students have
more opportunities to clarify their doubts and bridge their learning gaps.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 3 Critical Thinking and Presentation Skills Workshop</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Secondary 3 students commit an afternoon to honing the 21st Century
Competency of critical, adaptive and inventive thinking to enhance their
communication skills. At the end of the workshop, they are ready to present
their opinions with confidence and make their voices heard.</p>

<p><strong>Emcees training</strong>
</p>
<p>We train emcees for occasions like the annual Achieve and Excel Awards
Day. Emcees are selected from the list of students nominated by the English
teachers. They go through auditions, weekly training and practices, and
learn to think on their feet and adapt to changes. In the process, students
hone resilience and commitment to excel.</p>
