#### Curriculum

A good command of English is vital in this shrinking interconnected global village. The English curriculum recognises and leverages on the usefulness of the language to

*   fully appreciate another’s ideas and sentiments
*   clearly express one’s thoughts and feelings
*   make an impact on others by communicating fluently and persuasively

In addition, Literature cultivates empathy and nurture one’s sensitivity towards human emotions and experience, while the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) inculcates values through drama.  
  
The robust curriculum helps students to do well in school, post-secondary education and life.

#### Pedagogy

Enhancing English Learning and Teaching is a key approach developed in partnership with the Ministry of Education. This approach employs four teaching strategies:

*   Retelling
*   Process Writing
*   Reciprocal Teaching
*   Creative, Critical and Inventive Thinking

Students experience student-centric lessons and take ownership of their learning. Information and Communications Technology is harnessed to further both self-directed and collaborative learning. Visible Thinking strategies are taught to enhance thinking disposition to enable better learning outcome.  
  
Differentiated Instruction is another key approach to maximise the potential of all students. Customising lessons and opportunities for students of similar ability ensures strong language development.

#### Collaboration

Enhancing English Learning and Teaching is a partnership with MOE’s English Language and Literature Branch. On top of being one of the pioneering schools, Bukit View Secondary School teachers were featured in videos for training teachers nationwide and in lesson study cycles culminating in an article for Northstar Online Publication.  
  
The National KidsRead programme sees scores of students collaborating with the National Library Board to read stories aloud to primary one and two pupils. This nationwide reading programme promotes a love for reading and cultivates good reading habits among young Singaporeans.
