#### Mission

The Humanities Department aims to make every Bukit Viewan a concerned citizen through the learning of the Humanities. In Bukit View Secondary, our Humanities lessons are centred on the main pedagogical approach of Inquiry-Based Learning, with the teachers facilitating students’ learning through e-pedagogy, differentiated instructions and assessment for learning. We hope that Bukit Viewans will develop critical thinking skills, co-construct knowledge and be future-ready citizens who are concerned about sustainability and the current affairs.

Our Humanities teachers harness the use of ICT in the teaching and learning of the Humanities. Tapping on tools such as StoryMaps and Virtual Reality, we bring authentic learning experiences to the classroom and explicate the links between the Humanities curriculum to the real-world context. We create flipped learning resources, such as mind maps and podcasts to allow students to consolidate their learning at their own pace.

#### Key Programmes

**Geographical Investigation** <br>
Geographical Investigation allows students to have authentic learning experiences. Students are exposed to a variety of methods of data collection and analysis, allowing them to dive deep into exploring the themes and issues in their Geography curricula. Secondary 1 and 2 Bukit Viewans explore Bukit Batok’s nature parks and the neighbourhood, while Secondary 4 students venture out to Gardens by the Bay to examine tourism facilities. Our Geography team also leverages on 360° photographs and interactive maps to complement students’ field experience.



**Historical Investigation** <br>
Historical Investigation (HI) in Bukit View is designed to create authentic learning experiences for students in their inquiry of significant historical events. The four stages of Historical Inquiry (Asking questions, Gathering Data, Analysing sources, Drawing conclusions) come alive in HI, where students visit the National Museum of Singapore (NMS) to interact with historical sources. HI also taps on alternative assessments such as the creation of comics strips or collective diary to allow the outflow of students’ creativity as they demonstrate their understanding of historical events and concepts. In Bukit View, we also leverage on the use of virtual reality and Google Classroom to increase students’ interests and deepen their understanding of history.

**Learning Journeys** <br>
Through the various learning journeys, Bukit Viewans also have the opportunity to see the relevance of Humanities to the real world. Visits to Parliamentary Sittings for example allow Bukit Viewans to understand the functions and roles of a government. Our overseas learning journeys also seek to allow students to have authentic learning experiences of History and Geography beyond what is offered in Singapore.

#### Achievements

Given the robust Humanities learning experiences offered, Bukit Viewans have been performing well in the various fields of Humanities. In 2022 for example, our students attained the Bronze Medal Award for the Individual Component of the NUS Geography Challenge. Students also actively participate and present in Model United Nations Conferences where they engage in &nbsp;discussions on current affairs with like-minded students from other schools.
