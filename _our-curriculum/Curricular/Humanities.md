#### Pedagogy &amp; Programmes

Every humanities lesson is an exercise in inquiry. Students will develop critical thinking skills through questioning and data analysis while attaining subject mastery. ICT skills will also be embedded in the teaching and learning of Humanities at Bukit View Secondary. We aim to make every learner a concerned citizen by exposing students to a variety of themes and in-depth discussions of current affairs as part of our lessons.

*   Use of Visible Thinking routines to help students draw connections to what they are learning.
*   Use of Assessment Literacy in the classroom to stimulate critical and analytical thinking, as well as articulate their views and opinions.
*   Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is harnessed to further both self-directed and collaborative learning.
*   Mind mapping as an essential learning tool for organisation of core ideas and facilitating content mastery.
*   Geographical Investigation (GI) and Historical Investigation (HI) allow students to apply their theoretical knowledge in practical situations.
*   Local and overseas learning journeys inject excitement and add realism in the study of the Humanities.
