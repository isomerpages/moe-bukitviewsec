#### Mission

The Humanities Department aims to make every Bukit Viewan a concerned citizen through the learning of the Humanities. In Bukit View Secondary, our Humanities lessons are centred on the main pedagogical approach of Inquiry-Based Learning, with the teachers facilitating studentsâ€™ learning through e-pedagogy, differentiated instructions and assessment for learning. We hope that Bukit Viewans will develop critical thinking skills, co-construct knowledge and be future-ready citizens who are concerned about sustainability and the current affairs.

Our Humanities teachers harness the use of ICT in the teaching and learning of the Humanities. Tapping on tools such as StoryMaps and Virtual Reality, we bring authentic learning experiences to the classroom and explicate the links between the Humanities curriculum to the real-world context. We create flipped learning resources, such as mind maps and podcasts to allow students to consolidate their learning at their own pace.

Our teachers also believe in providing authentic opportunities to help our students understand the importance and value of Social Studies by exposing them to various competitions, seminars and even learning journeys!

#### Pedagogy &amp; Programmes

Every humanities lesson is an exercise in inquiry. Students will develop critical thinking skills through questioning and data analysis while attaining subject mastery. ICT skills will also be embedded in the teaching and learning of Humanities at Bukit View Secondary. We aim to make every learner a concerned citizen by exposing students to a variety of themes and in-depth discussions of current affairs as part of our lessons.

*   Use of Visible Thinking routines to help students draw connections to what they are learning.
*   Use of Assessment Literacy in the classroom to stimulate critical and analytical thinking, as well as articulate their views and opinions.
*   Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is harnessed to further both self-directed and collaborative learning.
*   Mind mapping as an essential learning tool for organisation of core ideas and facilitating content mastery.
*   Geographical Investigation (GI) and Historical Investigation (HI) allow students to apply their theoretical knowledge in practical situations.
*   Local and overseas learning journeys inject excitement and add realism in the study of the Humanities.
