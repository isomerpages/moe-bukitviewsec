<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>To empower students to explore the complexities of the human experience
by fostering critical thinking, empathy, and an appreciation for cultural
diversity. We aim to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and values
necessary to become informed, responsible, and compassionate global citizens.</p>
<p>Key Components:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Critical Thinking and Inquiry: </strong>Encouraging students to
ask questions, analyze sources, and evaluate different perspectives to
develop independent, evidence-based conclusions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cultural Awareness and Empathy:</strong> Promoting understanding
of diverse cultures, societies, landscapes and historical contexts to build
respect and empathy among students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ethical Citizenship:</strong> Fostering a sense of responsibility
to engage in social issues and contribute to positive societal change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Global Perspective:</strong> Helping students understand global
challenges and how they relate to local contexts, preparing them for an
interconnected world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>The Humanities Department is dedicated to empowering students to explore
the complexities of the human experience through critical inquiry, cultural
understanding, and ethical reflection. We strive to cultivate independent
thinkers who appreciate diversity, act with empathy, and engage thoughtfully
with the world around them. By fostering critical thinking, promoting global
awareness, and encouraging responsible citizenship, we prepare our students
to become informed, compassionate, and active participants in a diverse
and interconnected global society.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p>Our Social Studies Curriculum prepares students to be future-ready citizens
by helping them understand Singapore’s connections with the world and the
complexities of human experiences. Students are engaged through real-world
issues, fostering inquiry, critical thinking, and appreciation of diverse
perspectives. The 3 key issues students engage with include Exploring Citizenship
and Governance, Living in a Diverse Society and Being Part of a Globalised
World.</p>
<p>Our History curriculum aims to develop students’ appreciation of past
human experiences and a critical understanding of how historical knowledge
is formed. By studying the past, students can better understand present
realities and make informed decisions about the future. In Lower Secondary
levels, key topics include Singapore’s history from the 1300s to the 1970s.
At the Upper Secondary levels, students examine the impact of World War
I on Europe and the Asia-Pacific, as well as Cold War developments after
World War II.</p>
<p>Our Geography curriculum equips students with knowledge and skills to
understand and interpret the interactions between people and their environments.
Key topics include tropical rainforests, housing, tourism, and tectonics
and sustainable development, providing students with real-world connections
and critical thinking opportunities.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Pedagogy</h4>
<p>In Bukit View Secondary, our Humanities lessons are centred on the main
pedagogical approach of Inquiry-Based Learning, with the teachers facilitating
students’ learning through e-pedagogy, differentiated instructions and
assessment for learning. We adopt a learner-centred approach through differentiated
instruction (DI) to cater to varying readiness levels. Lessons include
customised worksheets, flexible groupings, and scaffolded tasks to support
and challenge learners appropriately. Technology tools such as 360° videos
and interactive story maps also enhance engagement and self-directed learning.
We hope that Bukit Viewans will develop critical thinking skills, co-construct
knowledge and be future-ready citizens who are concerned about sustainability
and the current affairs.</p>

<p>Historical Investigation (HI) at Bukit View Secondary School transforms
traditional historical inquiry into an engaging, experiential learning
journey. Through a four-stage approach of asking questions, gathering data,
analysing sources, and drawing conclusions, students investigate significant
historical events through museums visits and digital archives. The programme
encourages creative expression through innovative assessments like comic
strips and collective diaries. Through collaborative project work, students
develop essential communication and teamwork skills while building digital
literacy through Google Workspace platforms. This comprehensive approach
ensures both immediate educational impact and valuable long-term skills
development.</p>

<p>Our students also participate in Learning journeys which serve as valuable
educational experiences that bridge the gap between classroom learning
and real-world applications. By visiting significant places and engaging
with authentic environments, students develop a deeper understanding of
how humanities subjects like geography, history, and social studies intersect
with their everyday lives. Through such immersive encounters with significant
places, students form meaningful connections with the subject matter, transforming
knowledge learnt in class into tangible understanding and cultivating a
genuine appreciation for how humanities shape our modern world.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Geography</u></strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Students in Secondary 1 and 2 take part in Geographical Investigation
(GI), where they collect and analyse data related to their surroundings
within and beyond Bukit Batok. These field-based inquiries are enhanced
by digital tools to promote self-directed and experiential learning.</p>

<p>In the International Humanities Symposium at NJC, a team of students investigated
how technology and artificial intelligence can improve domestic recycling
in Singapore. Through interviews and surveys conducted in the Bukit Batok
area, they analysed local recycling behaviours and reviewed international
efforts. Their findings highlighted both the strengths and limitations
of solutions like reverse vending machines. Based on their research, the
team proposed improvements to enhance the functionality and accessibility
of blue recycling bins to better serve community needs.</p>
