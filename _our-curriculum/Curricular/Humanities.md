<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>Geographical Investigation</strong> 
<br>Geographical Investigation allows students to have authentic learning
experiences. Students are exposed to a variety of methods of data collection
and analysis, allowing them to dive deep into exploring the themes and
issues in their Geography curricula. Secondary 1 and 2 Bukit Viewans explore
Bukit Batok’s nature parks and the neighbourhood, while Secondary 4 students
venture out to Gardens by the Bay to examine tourism facilities. Our Geography
team also leverages on 360° photographs and interactive maps to complement
students’ field experience.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Investigation</strong> 
<br>Historical Investigation (HI) in Bukit View is designed to create authentic
learning experiences for students in their inquiry of significant historical
events. The four stages of Historical Inquiry (Asking questions, Gathering
Data, Analysing sources, Drawing conclusions) come alive in HI, where students
visit the National Museum of Singapore (NMS) to interact with historical
sources. HI also taps on alternative assessments such as the creation of
comics strips or collective diary to allow the outflow of students’ creativity
as they demonstrate their understanding of historical events and concepts.
In Bukit View, we also leverage on the use of virtual reality and Google
Classroom to increase students’ interests and deepen their understanding
of history.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Journeys</strong> 
<br>Through the various learning journeys, Bukit Viewans also have the opportunity
to see the relevance of Humanities to the real world. Visits to Parliamentary
Sittings for example allow Bukit Viewans to understand the functions and
roles of a government. Our overseas learning journeys also seek to allow
students to have authentic learning experiences of History and Geography
beyond what is offered in Singapore.</p>

<h4>Achievements</h4>
<p>Given the robust Humanities learning experiences offered, Bukit Viewans
have been performing well in the various fields of Humanities. In 2022
for example, our students attained the Bronze Medal Award for the Individual
Component of the NUS Geography Challenge. Students also actively participate
and present in Model United Nations Conferences where they engage in &nbsp;discussions
on current affairs with like-minded students from other schools.</p>
