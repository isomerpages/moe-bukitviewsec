#### MISSION

**_To develop reflective leaders who seek to meet the needs of the school community. We strive to build a peer support system in the school formed by students for students._**  

#### OVERVIEW

The Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) serves as the bridge between students and teachers by providing valuable peer to peer support for their peers through early identification to allow timely interventions. Through various trainings conducted during their years as PSLs, PSLs will be equipped with relevant skills to effectively act as the peer support of the school. Various bonding sessions such as the Secondary One Bonding sessions and the Teachersâ€™ Day Bonding are organised to facilitate interaction between classmates and schoolmates. The PSLs work hand in hand with the Student Council Board in various school activities.
