## JOULES (ALP)

#### The Junior OUtstanding Leaders in Energy for Sustainability (JOULES) Programme @BVSS

<b><u> Aim </b></u>

The JOULES (Junior OUtstanding Leaders in Energy for Sustainability) programme is a multi-disciplinary environmental Science Programme at Bukit View Secondary School. The focus of our programme is on **Clean Energy and Environmental Technology**.

This distinctive Applied Learning Programme (ALP) provides Bukit Viewans with experiential learning opportunities in design thinking and programming.  
The programme also emphasizes on the development of environmental student leadership.  
We hope that after going through the JOULES programme, Bukit Viewans will be keen to pursue STEM courses in institutes of higher education, especially in the area of environment and sustainable energy and thereby contribute to Singapore and the world. We also want Bukit Viewans to be ethical advocates who will pursue causes that benefit society, ensuring their values guide them as they make a difference beyond their school years.

<b><u> Approach </b></u>

<img src="/images/Joules-framework-300x300.jpg" style="width:30%">

The JOULES programme uses the 4P approach in designing and implementing the programmes – **Promote, Participate, Propagate, emPower**  
  
**Promote and Participate** – providing students with knowledge in environmental issues and experience in design thinking and programming. These experiences are infused in the curriculum through school wide programmes such as:

*   Secondary 1 and 2 JOULES programme
*   Secondary 3 JOULES+ programme (one day experience at Ngee Ann Polytechnic)

**Propagate and emPower** – providing student-leaders with the opportunity to pursue their interest in design thinking, programming, the environment and sustainable energy.  
Some of these opportunities include:

*   Thinking Hats Programme (Talent Development Programme for Sec 1 & 2)
*   Student Environmental Leadership Conference (SELC) (Sec 1 – 4)
*   Singapore Junior Water Prize (SJWP) (Sec 2 & 3)
*   Conducting guided Eco-trails for Primary Schools (Sec 1 – 4)
*   Advanced Elective Modules (Sec 2 – 4):
