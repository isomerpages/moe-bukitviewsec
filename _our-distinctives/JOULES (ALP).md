<h6><u>Aim</u></h6>

<p>This distinctive Applied Learning Programme (ALP) provides Bukit Viewans
with experiential learning opportunities in design thinking and programming.
<br>The programme also emphasizes on the development of environmental student
leadership.
<br>We hope that after going through the JOULES programme, Bukit Viewans will
be keen to pursue STEM courses in institutes of higher education, especially
in the area of environment and sustainable energy and thereby contribute
to Singapore and the world. We also want Bukit Viewans to be ethical advocates
who will pursue causes that benefit society, ensuring their values guide
them as they make a difference beyond their school years.</p>
