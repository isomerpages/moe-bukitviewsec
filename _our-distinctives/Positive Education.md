<p>In line with the school’s vision to develop Engaged Learners, Empathetic
Citizens and Ethical Advocates, BVSS adopts Positive Education as a whole-school
approach to increase students’ capacity to learn effectively, enhance resilience
and develop a learning community where students flourish and lead meaningful
lives.</p>
<p>Positive Education brings together the science of positive psychology
and best practices in teaching and learning to support students to thrive
in their learning environment. The primary aim of Positive Education is
to enhance students’ well-being and instill in them a greater sense of
purpose. When students feel good, they experience healthy levels of optimism,
emotional stability and resilience. When they do good, they learn to nurture
positive relationships, care for others and use their skills and knowledge
to contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
<p>In BVSS, we want our students to thrive. Developing an understanding of
one’s character strengths and utilising them in a variety of different
ways builds confidence and competence in our students.</p>
<p>We help students to flourish through these six domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Positive Relationships</strong>&nbsp;– We believe in helping our
students to develop social and emotional skills that strengthen their positive
relationships with their peers and teachers, and emphasise the importance
of connectedness and strong relationships for their well-being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positive Emotions</strong>&nbsp;– Through a culture of care in
the school, we seek to engender positive emotions of well-being such as
gratitude, hope and joy. We believe this will build up students’ resilience
and character strengths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positive Health</strong>&nbsp;– We provide opportunities for students
to develop sustainable habits for optimal physical and psychological health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positive Engagement</strong>&nbsp;– We provide meaningful learning
experiences for students across subjects and through the Applied Learning
Programme and Learning for Life Programme, so that they can experience
complete immersion in activities through understanding the nature of engagement,
the pathways to it and the impact it has on individual wellbeing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positive Accomplishment</strong>&nbsp;– We provide opportunities
for students to pursue their passions and deepen their mastery in various
disciplines to achieve meaningful outcomes. We provide support for students
to embrace challenges with grit, hope and a willingness to learn from their
experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positive Purpose</strong>&nbsp;– We believe that students extract
meaning by connecting their strengths and skills that they have developed
and making a positive difference to others, contributing to the greater
good by engaging in activities for the benefit of the community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Mindsets</h4>

<p>Our Positive Education approach is further enhanced by the learning mindsets
we hope our students will adopt.</p>
<p>Learning mindsets are beliefs and attitudes students need to possess to
enhance their motivation, engagement and achievement. Positive learning
mindsets allow students to be more engaged in their learning, demonstrate
a keen attitude and persist despite setbacks which will lead to positive
accomplishments.</p>
<p>We help students to thrive through these four learning mindsets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I belong to this learning community</strong>&nbsp;– When students
feel a sense of connectedness with their learning community, they will
strive to be more competent and have higher levels of intrinsic motivation.
They have a strong sense of identity and are willing to put in more effort
in their learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My ability and competence grow with my effort</strong>&nbsp;–
Students with a Growth Mindset believe that they can increase their capacity
by their own effort and demonstrate grit to work towards building competence.
They embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks and see effort
as the path to mastery. They learn from feedback and find lessons and inspiration
in the success of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I can succeed at this</strong>&nbsp;– When students believe that
success is possible and within their control, they tend to feel more confident
in their ability to complete assigned tasks. They are likely to succeed
in meeting academic demands in the classroom, willing to try hard and experience
zest in completing tasks, even if they find the work challenging or do
not experience immediate success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>This work has value for me</strong>&nbsp;– Students are naturally
motivated to learn when they perceive a task to be interesting and relevant.
When students are more interested in a subject or see a connection between
the academic tasks and their own future goals, they are more likely to
expand persistent effort and exhibit academic behaviours that support success
in their learning.</p>
</li>
