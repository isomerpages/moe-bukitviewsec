<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>To cultivate environmentally responsible individuals who champion sustainability
and drive positive change in their communities.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To instill a deep sense of environmental stewardship in every Bukit Viewan
by integrating sustainability into education, fostering innovation, and
inspiring meaningful action for a greener future.</p>
<h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Our approach to environmental education is anchored in experiential and
project-based learning. Through hands-on activities, students engage with
sustainability concepts in meaningful ways. Key pedagogical strategies
include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Inquiry-Based Learning:</strong> Encouraging students to explore
real-world environmental issues and develop solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gamification:</strong> Using interactive challenges such as the
GreenBound Challenge to make sustainability education engaging and impactful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Industry Collaboration:</strong> Partnering with organizations
like Samwoh Smart Hub to provide students with exposure to sustainable
practices in different sectors.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Student Leadership &amp; Advocacy</strong>: Empowering students
to lead sustainability efforts in class and beyond.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong><u>1. BVSS GreenBound Challenge</u></strong></h4>
<p>The BVSS GreenBound Challenge is a school-wide, app-based sustainability
competition that encourages students and staff to adopt eco-friendly habits
through fun and engaging tasks. With activities like recycling, volunteering,
and reducing waste, participants earn points for their classes, tracked
on a live leaderboard that fuels interclass competition.</p>
<p>The challenge has successfully met key recycling and volunteering targets,
promoting a strong sense of environmental responsibility. Through class
and individual awards, the initiative reinforces long-term sustainable
behaviour and empowers Bukit Viewans to take daily action for a greener
future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong><u>2. Sembenviro Recycling League</u></strong></h4>
<p>BVSS actively participates in this competition, <strong>achieving second place in the secondary school category</strong>.
This initiative encourages students to recycle plastic, paper, metal, and
e-waste, promoting a zero-waste culture.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Environmental Advocacy Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Every class has an appointed Environmental Advocate who champions green
habits and sustainable thinking among their peers. Advocates are equipped
with environmental knowledge through a Sustainability Advocacy e-module
on SLS, which culminates in a student-led green initiative.</p>
<p><u>Key responsibilities and activities include:</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Leading termly environmental class sharings to raise awareness of sustainable
habits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging daily recycling habits and setting up class recycling boxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Planning and executing a green advocacy activity based on real-world sustainability
challenges.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Level-wide Advocacy Roles:</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Secondary 1: Tree Care Initiative
<br>All Sec 1 classes are assigned trees around the school to care for. Students
learn to apply compost, water the trees, and monitor their growth, fostering
a sense of environmental stewardship and ownership of school greenery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary 2: Compost Stewardship
<br>Sec 2 Environmental Advocates perform biweekly composting duties. They
collect nutrient-rich compost from the school’s composter—created from
food waste disposed of by students and staff in the canteen—and sprinkle
it at the base of school trees to enrich the soil. This reinforces the
importance of a circular approach to waste and gives students a hands-on
role in reducing food waste and supporting tree growth.</p>
