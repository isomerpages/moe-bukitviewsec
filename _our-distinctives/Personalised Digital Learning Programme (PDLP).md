<p>Our teachers tap on educational technology to design effective lessons.
Technology is used not only to promote active, engaged, and self-directed
learning, but also enables teachers to better track their students’ understanding
of concepts taught and assess learning.</p>

<p><strong>Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of its commitment to nurturing future-ready learners, the Ministry
of Education had announced that all students in Singapore schools will
be supported in their learning by the&nbsp;<a href="https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)</a>,
an online learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources
and learning tools.</p>
<p>With the SLS, students will be able to learn better through the use of
technology. Students will be able to learn anytime, anywhere, and at their
own pace, whether independently or with their peers. Teachers will also
be able to use the SLS to complement their classroom teaching, further
enriching students’ learning experience. We believe such a learning experience
is essential to help your child to become an active and confident user
of technology.</p>
