Bukit View Secondary has been on the PDLP Journey since 2017. One of the first thing new Secondary 1 students would notice when they step into Bukit View Secondary are the Chromebooks held by every student.  
  
Bukit View Secondary aim to develop students who are

*   **Engaged Digital Learners**&nbsp;– active participants in digital learning who advocate a culture of collaborative learning through use of technology.  

*   **Empowered Digital Change Makers**&nbsp;– self-directed learners who set their own learning goals, practice critical and reflective thinking, and extend their own learning beyond the classroom.  

*   **Ethical Digital Users**&nbsp;– promote positive engagement, relationships and health in the digital domain.

Our teachers tap on educational technology to design effective lessons. Technology is used not only to promote active, engaged, and self-directed learning, but also enables teachers to better track their students’ understanding of concepts taught and assess learning.

**Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)**

As part of its commitment to nurturing future-ready learners, the Ministry of Education had announced that all students in Singapore schools will be supported in their learning by the&nbsp;[Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)](https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login), an online learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources and learning tools.  
  
With the SLS, students will be able to learn better through the use of technology. Students will be able to learn anytime, anywhere, and at their own pace, whether independently or with their peers. Teachers will also be able to use the SLS to complement their classroom teaching, further enriching students’ learning experience. We believe such a learning experience is essential to help your child to become an active and confident user of technology.

**Device Management Application (DMA)**

The Device Management Application (DMA) software is installed on all students' devices to provide a safe learning experience for your child, and to prevent misuse of the device. 

The DMA software consists of the following three components: 
* Mobile Device Management Service
* Classroom Management Service
* Usage Management Service
