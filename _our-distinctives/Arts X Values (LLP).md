## Arts X Values (LLP)

#### What is LLP?

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) implemented by MOE focusses on the affective aspect of students’ development.  
  
An LLP in the Arts typically involves self-discovery, character-building, honing of values, development of social-emotional skills, and learning of values through real-life arts activities.  
  
This consistent exposure and engagement in the Arts over the course of 4 or 5 years helps students to “unleash their human spirit, to find purpose, and to learn to live a good life.”

#### Learning for Life, Living the Values

Bukit View’s Learning for Life Programme, titled **_Learning the Arts, Living the Values,_** supports the learning of values, and developing socio and emotional competencies in our students through **drama**.

The LLP takes referenceCurr\_Framework.png from the school’s Curriculum Framework which is centred on a student-centric, values-driven education.  
  
Our Curriculum Framework articulates **_Critical and Inventive Thinking_** as a key component of achieving the 21st Century Student outcomes. The Learning for Life programme, in its advocacy of drama activism and delivery of drama experience to students, supports the development of Critical and Inventive Thinking in students through a substantial practice of **moral reasoning, perspective taking** and **reflection in every lesson**.
