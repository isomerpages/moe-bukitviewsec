## Arts X Values (LLP)

#### What is LLP?

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) implemented by MOE focusses on the affective aspect of students’ development.  
  
An LLP in the Arts typically involves self-discovery, character-building, honing of values, development of social-emotional skills, and learning of values through real-life arts activities.  
  
This consistent exposure and engagement in the Arts over the course of 4 or 5 years helps students to “unleash their human spirit, to find purpose, and to learn to live a good life.”

#### Learning for Life, Living the Values

Bukit View’s Learning for Life Programme, titled&nbsp;**_Learning the Arts, Living the Values,_**&nbsp;supports the learning of values, and developing socio and emotional competencies in our students through&nbsp;**drama**.

The LLP takes referenceCurr\_Framework.png from the school’s Curriculum Framework which is centred on a student-centric, values-driven education.  
  
Our Curriculum Framework articulates&nbsp;**_Critical and Inventive Thinking_**&nbsp;as a key component of achieving the 21st Century Student outcomes. The Learning for Life programme, in its advocacy of drama activism and delivery of drama experience to students, supports the development of Critical and Inventive Thinking in students through a substantial practice of&nbsp;**moral reasoning, perspective taking**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**reflection in every lesson**.

#### Aims of Bukit View Secondary LLP

These are the few broad aims of the LLP. The various LLP programmes throughout the school year strive to achieve the following :

*   To nurture and develop in students an appreciation for Drama and a keen sense of aesthetics
*   To promote the Arts (Drama) in our school and the wider community
*   To Enrich students’ classroom experience and provide a platform to learn a lifelong skill
*   To develop students’ social &amp; emotional competencies through the practice of drama
*   To provide students with breadth and depth of experience in contemporary theatre practices, in the context of authentic and real-life situations

_**Learning the Arts, Living the Values – Character Education Through Drama**_&nbsp;provides students with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes and self-expression. Drama as a pedagogy is a powerful tool to inspire creativity and confidence in students. How is it delivered?  
  
The LLP curriculum is delivered in two Tiers.  
  
Tier 1 is for all students in Sec 1 and 2 while Tier 2 is targeted at students with Drama CCA and others who display strong passion in pursuing drama at an advanced level.  
  
<u>_All students undergo&nbsp;Tier 1 Learning&nbsp;where they are exposed to and experience drama in the classroom._</u>

#### LLP lessons

A formal stand-alone enrichment drama syllabus carried our fortnightly by LLP teachers. Each double period delivers rich content through various drama activities. At the end of every lesson, students do a reflection of their learning, emphasising on the affective and moral effect of the issues discussed in the lessons.  
  
\*A key outcome of the LLP lesson is that Sec 1 and 2 students would be familiar with a host of drama techniques like Tableux, Hot Seating, onscience Alley and Improvisation among others. This makes it easier for drama to be harnessed as a pedagogical tool across all subjects as students grow in confidence and are equipped with basic inventory of drama routines by the end of Sec 2.

**LLP Learning Journey**<br>Students participate in a learning journey annually. They are brought to the theatre to appreciate drama and performance theatre. In 2015, Sec 1 students watched Jewels in the Tale by itheatre and Sec 2 enjoyed the musical Beauty and the Beast at MBS. The themes and values are discussed as a pre or post activity by the literature teachers.  
  
**Speech and Drama Workshops**<br>External agencies are invited to deliver workshops to enhance students’ skills learning.  
  
**Drama infused in Subjects**<br>Drama is utilised in academic subjects like Literature, English and Social Studies to achieve lesson objectives.  
  
**Drama as Assessment**<br>An alternative assessment for CA in literature is based on a drama task. Students present their individual or group work in the form of tableaux, flashback scenes and others.

#### Tier 2 Learning

is targeted at students who display strong passion and/or are interested in pursuing learning of drama at the advanced level.

**AEM @ RPA**<br>Partnership with Republic Polytechnic, this AEM allows students to learn to work behind the scenes and understand the mechanics of a performance play; from costume choice to lighting and sound for mood and atmosphere.  
  
**Learning Journey**<br>Learning journey to the theatre is catered to a more specific group of students based on their needs. In 2015, Sec 3 Lit Elective class attended SJI’s production of Lord of the Flies (their lit text) while the Sec 5N Social Studies group watched Titoudau as part of their Authentic Learning Day.  
  
**Literature Showcase**<br>An school-wide internal platform for students to display their talent. The Literature showcase is an avenue for talented students to be selected and perform for their peers in an assembly-like setting.  
  
**School Theatre Production**<br>A school wide audition was held in October for the cast of BVSS theatre production in 2016. These 20 tier-2 students will be trained by an external theatre group to prepare for their roles in the school’s first public theatre production. In 2018 and 2019, Sec 2 students were invited to put up performances at the Jurong Library to engage audiences to know more about the Bukit Batok neighbourhood(2018) and 5 forefathers (2019) of singapore, namely Mr Tan Tock Seng, Mr Yusof Ishak, Mr S Rajaratnam, Mr Goh Keng Swee and Miss Teresa Hsu.
