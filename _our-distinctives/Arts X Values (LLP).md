## Arts X Values (LLP)

#### What is LLP?

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) implemented by MOE focusses on the affective aspect of students’ development.

An LLP in the Arts typically involves self-discovery, character-building, honing of values, development of social-emotional skills, and learning of values through real-life arts activities.

This consistent exposure and engagement in the Arts over the course of 4 or 5 years helps students to “unleash their human spirit, to find purpose, and to learn to live a good life.”

#### Learning for Life, Living the Values

Bukit View’s Learning for Life Programme, titled&nbsp;**_Learning the Arts, Living the Values,_**&nbsp;supports the learning of values, and developing socio and emotional competencies in our students through&nbsp;**drama**.

#### Aims of Bukit View Secondary LLP

These are the aims of the LLP. The various LLP programmes throughout the school year strive to achieve the following :

*   To nurture and develop in students an appreciation for Drama and a keen sense of aesthetics
*   To promote the Arts in our school and the wider community
*   To Enrich students’ classroom experience and provide a platform to learn a lifelong skill
*   To develop students’ social &amp; emotional competencies through the practice of drama

_**Learning the Arts, Living the Values – Character Education Through Drama**_&nbsp;provides students with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes and self-expression. Drama as a pedagogy is a powerful tool to inspire creativity and confidence in students. How is it delivered?  
  
The LLP curriculum is delivered in two Tiers.  
  
Tier 1 is for all students in lower secondary while Tier 2 is targeted at students with an interest in the Arts such as Drama Club and other Visual/Performing Arts CCA. 
  
<u>***All students undergo&nbsp;Tier 1 Learning&nbsp;where they are exposed to and experience drama in the classroom.***</u>

**Drama-in-Curriculum (DIC)**

DIC lessons focusing on values are carried out every week by LLP teachers. Each double period delivers rich content through various drama activities. At the end of every lesson, students do a reflection of their learning, emphasising on the affective and moral effect of the issues discussed in the lessons.

Lesson overview : 
Secondary 1 students will go through a module of Introduction to Elements of Drama. Through drama games and group activities, students will develop stage confidence, collaborative skills and learn basic drama conventions in the classrooms. Scenario-based group discussion activities and performances are curated to inculcate values learning and perspective-taking.
In Secondary 2, students will immerse themselves in Applied Drama. Three drama tools will be taught to students : Forum Theatre, Conscience Alley and Hot Seating. In groups, students will then decide on a topic or issue that they would like to delve deeper into and advocate to their classmates. Students will apply then what they have learnt by presenting a skit and a facilitating an extension activity through their choice of the three drama tools.  
Selected Secondary 2 students will also be featured in our annual LLP showcase which will resume in 2024.

**LLP Learning Journey**<br>Students will get to experience a learning journey to theatre performances or visits to Institutes of higher learning when available. Over the years Bukit View students have had the opportunity to appreciate performances in the community and public theatres like the Marina Bay Sands as well as a backstage tour of the Esplanade. 

**Enrichment in Drama and other Arts**
<br>External agencies are invited to deliver workshops to enhance students’ skills learning and complement what they learn in Drama in LLP. Enrichment workshops to promote drama for the cohort include a Literature Appreciation Workshop and Puppetry Workshop. Lower Secondary students have also experienced Art Rangoli Workshop and Art Marbling Workshops to enhance their interest in Art.

**LLP Showcase**<br>After their two years journey in LLP, Secondary 2 students will be given the opportunity to showcase their talent at a public platform. Supported by the drama teachers, students would have autonomy in choosing the topic, coming up with original scripts and devising their performance on stage. Before the pandemic, Sec 2 LLP students have performed at the Singapore Heritage Festival (2018) and a showcase at Jurong Library (2019).
