<h4>What is LLP?</h4>
<p>The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) implemented by MOE focusses on the
affective aspect of students’ development.</p>
<p>An LLP in the Arts typically involves self-discovery, character-building,
honing of values, development of social-emotional skills, and learning
of values through real-life arts activities.</p>
<p>This consistent exposure and engagement in the Arts over the course of
4 or 5 years helps students to “unleash their human spirit, to find purpose,
and to learn to live a good life.”</p>
<h4>Learning for Life, Living the Values</h4>
<p>Bukit View’s Learning for Life Programme, titled&nbsp;<strong><em>Learning the Arts, Living the Values,</em></strong>&nbsp;supports
the learning of values, and developing socio and emotional competencies
in our students through&nbsp;<strong>drama</strong>.</p>

<h4>Aims of Bukit View Secondary LLP</h4>
<p>These are the aims of the LLP. The various LLP programmes throughout the
school year strive to achieve the following :</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To nurture and develop in students an appreciation for Drama and a keen
sense of aesthetics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To promote the Arts in our school and the wider community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To Enrich students’ classroom experience and provide a platform to learn
a lifelong skill</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop students’ social &amp; emotional competencies through the practice
of drama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide students with breadth and depth of experience in contemporary
theatre practices, in the context of authentic and real-life situations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Learning the Arts, Living the Values – Character Education Through Drama</em></strong>&nbsp;provides
students with real-life experiential learning to develop their character
and values, cultivate positive attitudes and self-expression. Drama as
a pedagogy is a powerful tool to inspire creativity and confidence in students.
How is it delivered?</p>
<p>The LLP curriculum is delivered in two Tiers.</p>
<p>Tier 1 is for all students in lower secondary while Tier 2 is targeted
at students with an interest in the Arts such as Drama Club and other Visual/Performing
Arts CCA.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>All students undergo&nbsp;Tier 1 Learning&nbsp;where they are exposed to and experience drama in the classroom.</u></em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Drama-in-Curriculum (DIC)</strong>
</p>
<p>DIC lessons focusing on values are carried out every week by LLP teachers.
Each double period delivers rich content through various drama activities.
At the end of every lesson, students do a reflection of their learning,
emphasising on the affective and moral effect of the issues discussed in
the lessons.</p>
<p>Lesson overview : Secondary 1 students will go through a module of Introduction
to Elements of Drama. Through drama games and group activities, students
will develop stage confidence, collaborative skills and learn basic drama
conventions in the classrooms. Scenario-based group discussion activities
and performances are curated to inculcate values learning and perspective-taking.
In Secondary 2, students will immerse themselves in Applied Drama. Three
drama tools will be taught to students : Forum Theatre, Conscience Alley
and Hot Seating. In groups, students will then decide on a topic or issue
that they would like to delve deeper into and advocate to their classmates.
Students will apply then what they have learnt by presenting a skit and
a facilitating an extension activity through their choice of the three
drama tools.

<p><strong>LLP Learning Journey</strong>
<br>Students will get to experience a learning journey to theatre performances
or visits to Institutes of higher learning when available. Over the years
Bukit View students have had the opportunity to appreciate performances
in the community and public theatres like the Marina Bay Sands as well
as a backstage tour of the Esplanade.</p>
<p><strong>Enrichment in Drama and other Arts</strong>
<br>External agencies are invited to deliver workshops to enhance students’
skills learning and complement what they learn in Drama in LLP. Enrichment
workshops to promote drama for the cohort include a Literature Appreciation
Workshop and Puppetry Workshop. Lower Secondary students have also experienced
Art Rangoli Workshop and Art Marbling Workshops to enhance their interest
in Art.</p>
